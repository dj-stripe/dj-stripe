Get Started! Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up local development. Fork dj-stripe on Github . Clone your fork locally: $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/dj-stripe.git Set up pre-commit : $ git init # A git repo is required to install pre-commit $ pre-commit install Set up your test database. If you're running tests using PostgreSQL: $ createdb djstripe or if you want to test vs sqlite (for convenience) or MySQL, they can be selected by setting this environment variable: $ export DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR = sqlite # or: export DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR=mysql For postgres and mysql, the database host,port,username and password can be set with environment variables, see tests/settings.py Install Poetry if you do not have it already. You can set up a virtual environment with: $ poetry install You can then, at any time, open a shell into that environment with: $ poetry shell When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests. A quick test run can be done as follows: $ DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR = sqlite poetry run pytest --reuse-db You should also check that the tests pass with other python and Django versions with tox. pytest will output both command line and html coverage statistics and will warn you if your changes caused code coverage to drop.: $ pip install tox $ tox If your changes altered the models you may need to generate Django migrations: $ DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR = sqlite poetry run ./manage.py makemigrations Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Congratulations, you're now a dj-stripe contributor! Have some \u2665 from us. Preferred Django Model Field Types When mapping from Stripe API field types to Django model fields, we try to follow Django best practises where practical. The following types should be preferred for fields that map to the Stripe API (which is almost all fields in our models). Strings Stripe API string fields have a default maximum length of 5,000 characters . In some cases a maximum length ( maxLength ) is specified in the Stripe OpenAPI schema . We follow Django's recommendation and avoid using null on string fields (which means we store \"\" for string fields that are null in stripe). Note that is enforced in the sync logic in StripeModel._stripe_object_to_record . For long string fields (eg above 255 characters) we prefer TextField over Charfield . Therefore the default type for string fields that don't have a maxLength specified in the Stripe OpenAPI schema should usually be: str_field = TextField(max_length=5000, default=\", blank=True, help_text=\"...\") Enumerations Fields that have a defined set of values can be implemented using StripeEnumField . Hash (dictionaries) Use the JSONField in djstripe.fields . Currency amounts Stripe handles all currency amounts as integer cents, we currently have a mixture of fields as integer cents and decimal (eg dollar, euro etc) values, but we are aiming to standardise on cents (see https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/955 ). All new currency amount fields should use StripeQuantumCurrencyAmountField . Dates and Datetimes The Stripe API uses an integer timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) for dates and datetimes. We store this as a datetime field, using StripeDateTimeField . Django Migration Policy Migrations are considered a breaking change, so it's not usually not acceptable to add a migration to a stable branch, it will be a new MAJOR.MINOR.0 release. A workaround to this in the case that the Stripe API data isn't compatible with out model (eg Stripe is sending null to a non-null field) is to implement the _manipulate_stripe_object_hook classmethod on the model. Avoid new migrations with non-schema changes If a code change produces a migration that doesn't alter the database schema (eg changing help_text ) then instead of adding a new migration you can edit the most recent migration that affects the field in question. e.g.: https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/commit/e2762c38918a90f00c42ecf21187a920bd3a2087 Pull Request Guidelines Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. The pull request must not drop code coverage below the current level. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring. If the pull request makes changes to a model, include Django migrations. The pull request should work for Python 3.6+. Check Github Actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Code formatting: Make sure to install pre-commit to automatically run it on staged files or run manually with pre-commit run --all-files at the dj-stripe root to keep a consistent style.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Important Note By default, keys are visible by anyone who has access to the dj-stripe administration. Adding new API keys You may add new API keys via the Dj-Stripe \"API key\" administration. The only required value is the key's \"secret\" value itself. Example: Once saved, Dj-Stripe will automatically detect whether the key is a public, restricted or secret key, and whether it's for live or test mode. If it's a secret key, the matching Account object will automatically be fetched as well and the key will be associated with it, so that it can be used to communicate with the Stripe API when dealing with objects belonging to that Account. Updating the API keys When expiring or rolling new secret keys, you should create the new API key in Stripe, then add it from the Django administration. Whenever you are ready, you may delete the old key. (It is safe to keep it around, as long as it hasn't expired. Keeping expired keys in the database may result in errors during usage). FAQ Why store them in the database? As we work on supporting multiple Stripe accounts per instance, it is vital for dj-stripe to have a mechanism to store more than one Stripe API key. It also became obvious that we may want proper programmatic access to create and delete keys. Furthermore, API keys are a legitimate upstream Stripe object, and it is not unlikely the API may allow access to listing other API keys in the future, in which case we will want to move them to the database anyway. Isn't that insecure? Please do keep your billing database encrypted. There's a copy of all your customers' billing data on it! You may also instead create a read-only restricted key with all-read permissions for dj-stripe. There is no added risk there, given that dj-stripe holds a copy of all your data regardless. I'm using environment variables. Do I need to change anything? Not at this time. The settings STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY can still be used. Their values will however be automatically saved to the database at the earliest opportunity. What about public keys? Setting STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY will be deprecated in 2.5.0. You do not risk anything by leaving them in your settings: They are not used by Dj-Stripe outside of the Dj-Stripe mixins, which are now themselves deprecated. So you can safely leave them in your settings, or you can move them to the database as well (Keys beginning in pk_test_ and pk_live_ will be detected as publishable keys).","title":"Managing Stripe API Keys"},{"location":"api_keys/#managing-stripe-api-keys","text":"Stripe API keys are stored in the database, and editable from the Django admin.

Do not upgrade to 1.2.0 directly from 1.0.1 or below. You must upgrade to 1.1.0 first. Please read the 1.1.0 release notes below for more information. 1.1.0 (2018-06-11) In dj-stripe 1.1.0, we made a lot of changes to models in order to bring the dj-stripe model state much closer to the upstream API objects. If you are a current user of dj-stripe, you will most likely have to make changes in order to upgrade. Please read the full changelog below. If you are having trouble upgrading, you may ask for help by filing an issue on GitHub . Migration reset The next version of dj-stripe, 1.2.0 , will reset all the migrations to 0001_initial . Migrations are currently in an unmaintainable state. What this means is you will not be able to upgrade directly to dj-stripe 1.2.0. You must go through 1.1.0 first, run ``manage.py migrate djstripe``, then upgrade to 1.2.0. Python 2.7 end-of-life dj-stripe 1.1.0 drops support for Django 1.10 and adds support for Django 2.0. Django 1.11+ and Python 2.7+ or 3.4+ are required. Support for Python versions older than 3.5, and Django versions older than 2.0, will be dropped in dj-stripe 2.0.0. Backwards-incompatible changes and deprecations Removal of polymorphic models The model architecture of dj-stripe has been simplified. Polymorphic models have been dropped and the old base StripeCustomer, StripeCharge, StripeInvoice, etc models have all been merged into the top-level Customer, Charge, Invoice, etc models. Importing those legacy models from djstripe.stripe_objects will yield the new ones. This is deprecated and support for this will be dropped in dj-stripe 2.0.0. Full support for Stripe Sources (Support for v3 stripe.js) Stripe sources ( src_XXXX ) are objects that can arbitrarily reference any of the payment method types that Stripe supports. However, the legacy Card object (with object IDs like card_XXXX or cc_XXXX ) is not a Source object, and cannot be turned into a Source object at this time. In order to support both Card and Source objects in ForeignKeys, a new model PaymentMethod has been devised (renamed to DjstripePaymentMethod in 2.0). That model can resolve into a Card, a Source, or a BankAccount object. The ``default_source`` attribute on ``Customer`` now refers to a ``PaymentMethod`` object . You will need to call .resolve() on it to get the Card or Source in question. References to Customer.sources expecting a queryset of Card objects should be updated to Customer.legacy_cards . The legacy StripeSource name refers to the Card model. This will be removed in dj-stripe 2.0.0. Update your references to either Card or Source . enums.SourceType has been renamed to enums.LegacySourceType . enums.SourceType now refers to the actual Stripe Source types enum. Core fields renamed The numeric id field has been renamed to djstripe_id . This avoids a clash with the upstream stripe id. Accessing .id is deprecated and **will reference the upstream stripe_id in dj-stripe 2.0.0 1.0.0 (2017-08-12) It's finally here! We've made significant changes to the codebase and are now compliant with stripe API version 2017-06-05 . I want to give a huge thanks to all of our contributors for their help in making this happen, especially Bill Huneke (@wahuneke) for his impressive design work and @jleclanche for really pushing this release along. I also want to welcome onboard two more maintainers, @jleclanche and @lskillen. They've stepped up and have graciously dedicated their resources to making dj-stripe such an amazing package. Almost all methods now mimic the parameters of those same methods in the stripe API. Note that some methods do not have some parameters implemented. This is intentional. That being said, expect all method signatures to be different than those in previous versions of dj-stripe. Finally, please note that there is still a bit of work ahead of us. Not everything in the Stripe API is currently supported by dj-stripe -- we're working on it. That said, v1.0.0 has been thoroughly tested and is verified stable in production applications. A few things to get excited for Multiple subscription support (finally) Multiple sources support (currently limited to Cards) Idempotency support (See #455, #460 for discussion -- big thanks to @jleclanche) Full model documentation Objects that come through webhooks are now tied to the API version set in dj-stripe. No more errors if dj-stripe falls behind the newest stripe API version. Any create/update action on an object automatically syncs the object. Concurrent LIVE and TEST mode support (Thanks to @jleclanche). Note that you'll run into issues if livemode isn't set on your existing customer objects. All choices are now enum-based (Thanks @jleclanche, See #520). Access them from the new djstripe.enums module. The ability to check against model property based choices will be deprecated in 1.1 Support for the Coupon model, and coupons on Customer objects. Support for the Payout/Transfer split from api version 2017-04-06 . What still needs to be done (in v1.1.0) Documentation . Our original documentation was not very helpful, but it covered the important bits. It will be very out of date after this update and will need to be rewritten. If you feel like helping, we could use all the help we can get to get this pushed out asap. Master sync re-write . This sounds scary, but really isn't. The current management methods run sync methods on Customer that aren't very helpful and are due for removal. My plan is to write something that first updates local data (via api_retrieve and sync_from_stripe_data ) and then pulls all objects from Stripe and populates the local database with any records that don't already exist there. You might be wondering, \"Why are they releasing this if there are only a few things left?\" Well, that thinking turned this into a two year release... Trust me, this is a good thing. Significant changes (mostly backwards-incompatible) Idempotency . #460 introduces idempotency keys and implements idempotency for Customer.get_or_create() . Idempotency will be enabled for all calls that need it. Improved Admin Interface . This is almost complete. See #451 and #452. Drop non-trivial endpoint views . We're dropping everything except the webhook endpoint and the subscription cancel endpoint. See #428. Drop support for sending receipts . Stripe now handles this for you. See #478. Drop support for plans as settings , including custom plan hierarchy (if you want this, write something custom) and the dynamic trial callback. We've decided to gut having plans as settings. Stripe should be your source of truth; create your plans there and sync them down manually. If you need to create plans locally for testing, etc., simply use the ORM to create Plan models. The sync rewrite will make this drop less annoying. Orphan Customer Sync . We will now sync Customer objects from Stripe even if they aren't linked to local subscriber objects. You can link up subscribers to those Customers manually. Concurrent Live and Test Mode . dj-stripe now supports test-mode and live-mode Customer objects concurrently. As a result, the User.customer One-to-One reverse-relationship is now the User.djstripe_customers RelatedManager. (Thanks @jleclanche) #440. You'll run into some dj-stripe check issues if you don't update your KEY settings accordingly. Check our GitHub issue tracker for help on this. SETTINGS The PLAN_CHOICES , PLAN_LIST , and PAYMENT_PLANS objects are removed. Use Plan.objects.all() instead. The plan_from_stripe_id function is removed. Use Plan.objects.get(stripe_id=) SYNCING sync_plans no longer takes an api_key sync methods no longer take a cu parameter All sync methods are now private. We're in the process of building a better syncing mechanism. UTILITIES dj-stripe decorators now take a plan argument. If you're passing in a custom test function to subscriber_passes_pay_test , be sure to account for this new argument. MIXINS The context provided by dj-stripe's mixins has changed. PaymentsContextMixin now provides STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and plans (changed to Plan.objects.all() ). SubscriptionMixin now provides customer and is_plans_plural . We've removed the SubscriptionPaymentRequiredMixin. Use @method_decorator(\"dispatch\", subscription_payment_required ) instead. MIDDLEWARE dj-stripe middleware doesn't support multiple subscriptions. SIGNALS Local custom signals are deprecated in favor of Stripe webhooks: cancelled -> WEBHOOK_SIGNALS[\"customer.subscription.deleted\"] card_changed -> WEBHOOK_SIGNALS[\"customer.source.updated\"] subscription_made -> WEBHOOK_SIGNALS[\"customer.subscription.created\"] WEBHOOK EVENTS The Event Handlers designed by @wahuneke are the new way to handle events that come through webhooks. Definitely take a look at event_handlers.py and webhooks.py . EXCEPTIONS SubscriptionUpdateFailure and SubscriptionCancellationFailure exceptions are removed. There should no longer be a case where they would have been useful. Catch native stripe errors in their place instead. MODELS CHARGE Charge.charge_created -> Charge.stripe_timestamp Charge.card_last_4 and Charge.card_kind are removed. Use Charge.source.last4 and Charge.source.brand (if the source is a Card) Charge.invoice is no longer a foreign key to the Invoice model. Invoice now has a OneToOne relationship with Charge . ( Charge.invoice will still work, but will no longer be represented in the database). CUSTOMER dj-stripe now supports test mode and live mode Customer objects concurrently (See #440). As a result, the <subscriber_model>.customer OneToOne reverse relationship is no longer a thing. You should now instead add a customer property to your subscriber model that checks whether you're in live or test mode (see djstripe.settings.STRIPE_LIVE_MODE as an example) and grabs the customer from <subscriber_model>.djstripe_customers with a simple livemode= filter. Customer no longer has a current_subscription property. We've added a subscription property that should suit your needs. With the advent of multiple subscriptions, the behavior of Customer.subscribe() has changed. Before, calling subscribe() when a customer was already subscribed to a plan would switch the customer to the new plan with an option to prorate. Now calling subscribe() simply subscribes that customer to a new plan in addition to it's current subsription. Use Subscription.update() to change a subscription's plan instead. Customer.cancel_subscription() is removed. Use Subscription.cancel() instead. The Customer.update_plan_quantity() method is removed. Use Subscription.update() instead. CustomerManager is now SubscriptionManager and works on the Subscription model instead of the Customer model. Customer.has_valid_card() is now Customer.has_valid_source() . Customer.update_card() now takes an id. If the id is not supplied, the default source is updated. Customer.stripe_customer property is removed. Use Customer.api_retrieve() instead. The at_period_end parameter of Customer.cancel_subscription() now actually follows the DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY setting. Customer.card_fingerprint , Customer.card_last_4 , Customer.card_kind , Customer.card_exp_month , Customer.card_exp_year are all removed. Check Customer.default_source (if it's a Card) or one of the sources in Customer.sources (again, if it's a Card) instead. The invoice_id parameter of Customer.add_invoice_item is now named invoice and can be either an Invoice object or the stripe_id of an Invoice. EVENT Event.kind -> Event.type Removed Event.validated_message . Just check if the event is valid no need to double check (we do that for you) TRANSFER Removed Transfer.update_status() Removed Transfer.event TransferChargeFee is removed. It hasn't been used in a while due to a broken API version. Use Transfer.fee_details instead. Any fields that were in Transfer.summary no longer exist and are therefore deprecated (unused but not removed from the database). Because of this, TransferManager now only aggregates total_sum INVOICE Invoice.attempts -> Invoice.attempt_count InvoiceItems are no longer created when Invoices are synced. You must now sync InvoiceItems directly. INVOICEITEM Removed InvoiceItem.line_type PLAN Plan no longer has a stripe_plan property. Use api_retrieve() instead. Plan.currency no longer uses choices. Use the get_supported_currency_choices() utility and create your own custom choices list instead. Plan interval choices are now in Plan.INTERVAL_TYPE_CHOICES SUBSCRIPTION Subscription.is_period_current() now checks for a current trial end if the current period has ended. This change means subscriptions extended with Subscription.extend() will now be seen as valid. MIGRATIONS We'll sync your current records with Stripe in a migration. It will take a while, but it's the only way we can ensure data integrity. There were some fields for which we needed to temporarily add placeholder defaults, so just make sure you have a customer with ID 1 and a plan with ID 1 and you shouldn't run into any issues (create dummy values for these if need be and delete them after the migration). BIG HUGE NOTE - DON'T OVERLOOK THIS Warning Subscription and InvoiceItem migration is not possible because old records don't have Stripe IDs (so we can't sync them). Our approach is to delete all local subscription and invoiceitem objects and re-sync them from Stripe. We 100% recommend you create a backup of your database before performing this upgrade. Other changes Postgres users now have access to the DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD setting.

New feature: in-database Stripe API keys Stripe API keys are now stored in the database, and are now editable in the admin. Warning By default, all keys are visible by anyone who has access to the dj-stripe administration. Why? As we work on supporting multiple Stripe accounts per instance, it is vital for dj-stripe to have a mechanism to store more than one Stripe API key. It also became obvious that we may want proper programmatic access to create and delete keys. Furthermore, API keys are a legitimate upstream Stripe object, and it is not unlikely the API may allow access to listing other API keys in the future, in which case we will want to move them to the database anyway. In the next release, we are planning to make WebhookEndpoints (and thus webhook secrets) manageable via the database as well. Do I need to change anything? Not at this time. The settings STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY can still be used. Their values will however be automatically saved to the database at the earliest opportunity. What about public keys? Setting STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY will be deprecated next release. You do not risk anything by leaving them in your settings: They are not used by Dj-Stripe outside of the Dj-Stripe mixins, which are now themselves deprecated. So you can safely leave them in your settings, or you can move them to the database as well (Keys beginning in pk_test_ and pk_live_ will be detected as publishable keys). Deprecated features Nobody likes features being removed. However, the last few releases we have had to remove features that were not core to what dj-stripe does, or simply poorly-maintained. To keep up with the trend, we are making three major deprecations this release: Creating Plans from the Django Admin is no longer supported The Plan model was special cased in various places, including being the only one which supported being created from the Django administration. This is no longer supported. We have plans to allow creating arbitrary Stripe objects from the Django Admin, but until it can be done consistently, we have decided to remove the feature for Plans (which are deprecated by Stripe anyway). The only object type you should be dealing with from the admin is the new APIKey model. Along with this, we are also deprecating the djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe management command. You can instead use the djstripe_sync_models management command, which supports arbitrary models. Deprecating the REST API We are dropping all support for the REST API and will be fully removing it in 2.5.0. We're doing this because we wish to keep such an API separate from dj-stripe. Work has already started on a new project, and we will be sharing more details about it soon. If you're interested in helping out, please reach out on Github ! Deprecating djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware Large parts of dj-stripe, including this middleware, were designed before Stripe's major revamps of the old Plan model into Prices, Products, and multi-plan subscriptions. The functionality offered by the middleware is no longer adequate, and building on top of it would not be particularly robust. We may bring similar functionality back in the future, but the middleware as it is is going away (as well as the undocumented djstripe.utils.subscriber_has_active_subscription utility function). If you want to keep the functionality for your project, you may wish to copy the latest version of the middleware . Deprecating djstripe.mixins This is being deprecated for similar reasons as the SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware. However, the mixins module was undocumented and never officially supported. Other deprecations The account field on Charge has been renamed to on_behalf_of , to be consistent with Stripe's upstream model. Note that this field is separate from djstripe_owner_account , which is set by dj-stripe itself to match the account of the API key used. Account.get_connected_account_from_token() is deprecated in favour of Account.get_or_retrieve_for_api_key() , which supports more than just Connect accounts. Customer.has_active_subscription() is deprecated in favour of Customer.is_subscribed_to() . Note that the former takes a plan as argument, whereas the latter takes a product as argument. The tax_percent attribute of Invoice is no longer populated and will be removed in 2.5.0. You may want to use Invoice.default_tax_rates instead, which uses the new TaxId functionality. Customer.business_vat_id is being deprecated in favour of using TaxId models directly. Breaking changes Rename PlanBillingScheme to BillingScheme. Remove Plan.update_name() and these previously-deprecated fields: Customer.business_vat_id Subscription.start Subscription.billing Upgrade Guide Before you upgrade to dj-stripe 2.4.0, we recommend upgrading to dj-stripe 2.3.0. Upgrading one major release at a time minimizes the risk of issues arising. Upgrading directly to 2.4.0 from dj-stripe versions older than 2.2.0 is unsupported. To upgrade dj-stripe, run pip install --upgrade dj-stripe==2.4.0 . Once installed, you can run manage.py migrate djstripe to migrate the database models. Attention If you are doing multiple major dj-stripe upgrades in a row, remember to run the migrate command after every upgrade. Skipping this step WILL cause errors. Note Migrating the database models may take a long time on databases with large amounts of customers. Settings changes A new mandatory setting DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD has been added. If you are upgrading from an older version, you need to set it to \"djstripe_id\" . Setting it to \"id\" will make dj-stripe use the Stripe IDs as foreign keys. Although this is recommended for new installations, there is currently no migration available for going from \"djstripe_id\" to \"id\" .

This is intended to be part of the 3.0 release, since it will involve some breaking changes. See #955 for details and discussion. 2.1.0 (2019-09-12) Dropped Django 2.0 support The Python stripe library minimum version is now 2.32.0 , also 2.36.0 is excluded due to a regression (#991). Dropped previously-deprecated Charge.fee_details property. Dropped previously-deprecated Transfer.fee_details property. Dropped previously-deprecated field_name parameter to sync_from_stripe_data Dropped previously-deprecated alias StripeObject of StripeModel Dropped previously-deprecated alias PaymentMethod of DjstripePaymentMethod Dropped previously-deprecated properties Charge.source_type and Charge.source_stripe_id enums.PaymentMethodType has been deprecated, use enums.DjstripePaymentMethodType Made SubscriptionItem.quantity nullable as per Plans with usage_type=\"metered\" (follow-up to #865) Added manage commands djstripe_sync_models and djstripe_process_events (#727, #89) Fixed issue with re-creating a customer after Customer.purge() (#916) Fixed sync of Customer Bank Accounts (#829) Fixed Subscription.is_status_temporarily_current() (#852) New models Payment Intent Setup Intent Payment Method Session Added fields to Customer model: address , invoice_prefix , invoice_settings , phone , preferred_locales , tax_exempt Changes from API 2018-11-08: Added Invoice.auto_advance , deprecated Invoice.closed and Invoice.forgiven , see https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/invoice-states#upgrade-checklist Changes from API 2019-02-19: Major changes to Account fields, see https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-02-19 , updated Account fields to match API 2019-02-19: Added Account.business_profile , .business_type , .company , .individual , .requirements , .settings Deprecated the existing fields, to be removed in 2.2 Special handling of the icon and logo fields: > - Renamed Account.business_logo to Account.branding_icon > (note that in Stripe's API Account.business_logo was renamed > to Account.settings.branding_icon , and > Account.business_logo_large (which we didn't have a field > for) was renamed to Account.settings.branding_logo ) > - Added deprecated property for Account.business_logo > - Added Account.branding_logo as a ForeignKey > - Populate Account.branding_icon and .branding_logo from the > new Account.settings.branding.icon and .logo Changes from API 2019-03-14: Renamed Invoice.application_fee to Invoice.application_fee_amount (added deprecated property for the old name) Removed Invoice.date , in place of Invoice.created (added deprecated property for the old name) Added Invoice.status_transitions Renamed Customer.account_balance to Customer.balance (added deprecated property for the old name) Renamed Customer.payment_methods to Customer.customer_payment_methods Added new SubscriptionStatus.incomplete and SubscriptionStatus.incomplete_expired statuses (#974) Added new BalanceTransactionType values (#983) Squashed dev migrations As per our migration policy , unreleased migrations on the master branch have been squashed. If you have been using the 2.1.0dev branch from master, you'll need to run the squashed migrations migrations before upgrading to >=2.1.0. The simplest way to do this is to pip install dj-stripe==2.1.0rc0 and migrate, alternatively check out the 2.1.0rc0 git tag. 2.0.5 (2019-09-12) This is a bugfix-only version: Avoid stripe==2.36.0 due to regression (#991) 2.0.4 (2019-09-09) This is a bugfix-only version: Fixed irreversible migration (#909) 2.0.3 (2019-06-11) This is a bugfix-only version: In _get_or_create_from_stripe_object , wrap create _create_from_stripe_object in transaction, fixes TransactionManagementError on race condition in webhook processing (#877, #903). 2.0.2 (2019-06-09) This is a bugfix-only version: Don't save event objects if the webhook processing fails (#832). Fixed IntegrityError when REMOTE_ADDR is an empty string. Deprecated field_name parameter to sync_from_stripe_data 2.0.1 (2019-04-29) This is a bugfix-only version: Fixed an error on invoiceitem.updated (#848). Handle test webhook properly in recent versions of Stripe API (#779). At some point 2018 Stripe silently changed the ID used for test events and evt_00000000000000 is not used anymore. Fixed OperationalError seen in migration 0003 on postgres (#850). Fixed issue with migration 0003 not being unapplied correctly (#882). Fixed missing SubscriptionItem.quantity on metered Plans (#865). Fixed Plan.create() (#870). 2.0.0 (2019-03-01) The Python stripe library minimum version is now 2.3.0 . PaymentMethod has been renamed to DjstripePaymentMethod (#841). An alias remains but will be removed in the next version. Dropped support for Django<2.0, Python<3.4. Dropped previously-deprecated stripe_objects module. Dropped previously-deprecated stripe_timestamp field. Dropped previously-deprecated Charge.receipt_number field. Dropped previously-deprecated StripeSource alias for Card Dropped previously-deprecated SubscriptionView , CancelSubscriptionView and CancelSubscriptionForm . Removed the default value from DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REDIRECT . All stripe_id fields have been renamed id . Charge.source_type has been deprecated. Use Charge.source.type . Charge.source_stripe_id has been deprecated. Use Charge.source.id . All deprecated Transfer fields (Stripe API 2017-04-06 and older), have been dropped. This includes date , destination_type ( type ), failure_code , failure_message , statement_descriptor and status . Fixed IntegrityError when REMOTE_ADDR is missing (#640). New models: ApplicationFee ApplicationFeeRefund BalanceTransaction CountrySpec ScheduledQuery SubscriptionItem TransferReversal UsageRecord The fee and fee_details attributes of both the Charge and Transfer objects are no longer stored in the database. Instead, they access their respective new balance_transaction foreign key. Note that fee_details has been deprecated on both models. The fraudulent attribute on Charge is now a property that checks the fraud_details field. Object key validity is now always enforced (#503). Customer.sources no longer refers to a Card queryset, but to a Source queryset. In order to correctly transition, you should change all your references to customer.sources to customer.legacy_cards instead. The legacy_cards attribute already exists in 1.2.0. Customer.sources_v3 is now named Customer.sources . A new property Customer.payment_methods is now available, which allows you to iterate over all of a customer's payment methods (sources then cards). Card.customer is now nullable and cards are no longer deleted when their corresponding customer is deleted (#654). Webhook signature verification is now available and is preferred. Set the DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET setting to your secret to start using it. StripeObject has been renamed StripeModel . An alias remains but will be removed in the next version. The metadata key used in the Customer object can now be configured by changing the DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY setting. Setting this to None or an empty string now also disables the behaviour altogether. Text-type fields in dj-stripe will no longer ever be None. Instead, any falsy text field will return an empty string. Switched test runner to pytest-django StripeModel.sync_from_stripe_data() will now automatically retrieve related objects and populate foreign keys (#681) Added Coupon.name Added Transfer.balance_transaction Exceptions in webhooks are now re-raised as well as saved in the database (#833)","title":"dj-stripe 2.0 ~ 2.3 release notes"},{"location":"history/2_x/#dj-stripe-20-23-release-notes","text":"","title":"dj-stripe 2.0 ~ 2.3 release notes"},{"location":"history/2_x/#230-2020-04-19","text":"The minimum version of Django is now 2.1, and Python 3.6.

Charge.source_stripe_id has been deprecated. Use Charge.source.id . All deprecated Transfer fields (Stripe API 2017-04-06 and older), have been dropped. This includes date , destination_type ( type ), failure_code , failure_message , statement_descriptor and status . Fixed IntegrityError when REMOTE_ADDR is missing (#640). New models: ApplicationFee ApplicationFeeRefund BalanceTransaction CountrySpec ScheduledQuery SubscriptionItem TransferReversal UsageRecord The fee and fee_details attributes of both the Charge and Transfer objects are no longer stored in the database. Instead, they access their respective new balance_transaction foreign key. Note that fee_details has been deprecated on both models. The fraudulent attribute on Charge is now a property that checks the fraud_details field. Object key validity is now always enforced (#503). Customer.sources no longer refers to a Card queryset, but to a Source queryset. In order to correctly transition, you should change all your references to customer.sources to customer.legacy_cards instead. The legacy_cards attribute already exists in 1.2.0. Customer.sources_v3 is now named Customer.sources . A new property Customer.payment_methods is now available, which allows you to iterate over all of a customer's payment methods (sources then cards). Card.customer is now nullable and cards are no longer deleted when their corresponding customer is deleted (#654). Webhook signature verification is now available and is preferred. Set the DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET setting to your secret to start using it. StripeObject has been renamed StripeModel . An alias remains but will be removed in the next version. The metadata key used in the Customer object can now be configured by changing the DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY setting. Setting this to None or an empty string now also disables the behaviour altogether. Text-type fields in dj-stripe will no longer ever be None. Instead, any falsy text field will return an empty string. Switched test runner to pytest-django StripeModel.sync_from_stripe_data() will now automatically retrieve related objects and populate foreign keys (#681) Added Coupon.name Added Transfer.balance_transaction Exceptions in webhooks are now re-raised as well as saved in the database (#833)","title":"2.0.0 (2019-03-01)"},{"location":"project/authors/","text":"Credits Core contributors Alexander Kavanaugh (Co-maintainer) Jerome Leclanche (Co-maintainer) Arnav Choudhury Former core contributors John Carter Pablo Castellano Daniel Greenfeld Lee Skillen Contributors dj-stripe is brought to you by many more open source contributors.

Write Documentation dj-stripe could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official dj-stripe docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. To see the project's documentation live, run the following command: mkdocs serve The documentation site will then be served on http://127.0.0.1:8000 . In case of any installation error In case you get the error that some plugin is not installed, please run: poetry install --with docs If you wish to just generate the documentation, you can replace serve with build , and the docs will be generated into the site/ folder. Submit Feedback The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues . If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :) Contributor Discussion For questions regarding contributions to dj-stripe, another avenue is our Discord channel at https://discord.gg/UJY8fcc . Get Started! Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up local development. Fork dj-stripe on Github . Clone your fork locally: $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/dj-stripe.git Set up pre-commit : $ git init # A git repo is required to install pre-commit $ pre-commit install Set up your test database. If you're running tests using PostgreSQL: $ createdb djstripe or if you want to test vs sqlite (for convenience) or MySQL, they can be selected by setting this environment variable: $ export DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR = sqlite # or: export DJSTRIPE_TEST_DB_VENDOR=mysql For postgres and mysql, the database host,port,username and password can be set with environment variables, see tests/settings.py Install Poetry if you do not have it already. You can set up a virtual environment with: $ poetry install You can then, at any time, open a shell into that environment with: $ poetry shell When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests.

Congratulations, you're now a dj-stripe contributor! Have some \u2665 from us. Preferred Django Model Field Types When mapping from Stripe API field types to Django model fields, we try to follow Django best practises where practical. The following types should be preferred for fields that map to the Stripe API (which is almost all fields in our models). Strings Stripe API string fields have a default maximum length of 5,000 characters . In some cases a maximum length ( maxLength ) is specified in the Stripe OpenAPI schema . We follow Django's recommendation and avoid using null on string fields (which means we store \"\" for string fields that are null in stripe). Note that is enforced in the sync logic in StripeModel._stripe_object_to_record . For long string fields (eg above 255 characters) we prefer TextField over Charfield . Therefore the default type for string fields that don't have a maxLength specified in the Stripe OpenAPI schema should usually be: str_field = TextField(max_length=5000, default=\", blank=True, help_text=\"...\") Enumerations Fields that have a defined set of values can be implemented using StripeEnumField . Hash (dictionaries) Use the JSONField in djstripe.fields . Currency amounts Stripe handles all currency amounts as integer cents, we currently have a mixture of fields as integer cents and decimal (eg dollar, euro etc) values, but we are aiming to standardise on cents (see https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/955 ). All new currency amount fields should use StripeQuantumCurrencyAmountField . Dates and Datetimes The Stripe API uses an integer timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) for dates and datetimes. We store this as a datetime field, using StripeDateTimeField . Django Migration Policy Migrations are considered a breaking change, so it's not usually not acceptable to add a migration to a stable branch, it will be a new MAJOR.MINOR.0 release. A workaround to this in the case that the Stripe API data isn't compatible with out model (eg Stripe is sending null to a non-null field) is to implement the _manipulate_stripe_object_hook classmethod on the model. Avoid new migrations with non-schema changes If a code change produces a migration that doesn't alter the database schema (eg changing help_text ) then instead of adding a new migration you can edit the most recent migration that affects the field in question. e.g.: https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/commit/e2762c38918a90f00c42ecf21187a920bd3a2087 Pull Request Guidelines Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. The pull request must not drop code coverage below the current level. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring. If the pull request makes changes to a model, include Django migrations. The pull request should work for Python 3.6+. Check Github Actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Code formatting: Make sure to install pre-commit to automatically run it on staged files or run manually with pre-commit run --all-files at the dj-stripe root to keep a consistent style.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"project/contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Rationale These fixtures are partly hand-coded and partly generated by creating objects in Stripe and then retrieved via the API. Each approach has pros and cons: Hand-coding the fixtures allows them to be crafted specifically for a test case. They can also be terse, and nested objects can be done by reference to avoid duplication. But maintaining or upgrading them is a painstaking manual process. Generating the fixtures via Stripe gives the big advantage that Stripe schema changes are automatically represented in the fixtures, which should allow us to upgrade dj-stripe's schema to match Stripe much more easily. This would be done by updating dj-stripe's targeted API version ( DEFAULT_STRIPE_API_VERSION ), regenerating the fixtures, and updating the model to match the fixture changes. The down side is it's tricky to regenerate fixture files without introducing big changes (eg to object ids) - the script does this by mapping a dummy id to various objects. Regenerating the test fixtures To regenerate the test fixtures (e.g. to populate the fixtures with new API fields from Stripe), do the following: (one time only) Create a new Stripe account called \"dj-stripe scratch\", with country set to United States. (we use US so the currency matches the existing fixtures matches, in the future it would be good to test for other countries). If you already had this account ready and want to start again from scratch, you can delete all of the test data via the button in Settings > Data https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/data Activate a virtualenv with the dj-stripe project (see Getting Started) Set the dj-stripe secret key environment variable to the secret key for this account ( export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... ) Run the manage command to create the test objects in your stripe account if they don't already exist, and regenerate the local fixture files from them: $ ./manage.py regenerate_test_fixtures The command tries to avoid inconsequential changes to the fixtures (e.g the created timestamp) by restoring a whitelist of values from the existing fixtures.

Once an invoice is created, payment is automatically attempted. Note that the payment, while automatic, does not happen exactly at the time of invoice creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice will wait until one hour after the last webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times out after failing). Any customer credit on the account is applied before determining how much is due for that invoice (the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a charge), we add the amount to the customer's running account balance to be added to the next invoice. If this amount is negative, it will act as a credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance does not include unpaid invoices; it only includes balances that need to be taken into account when calculating the amount due for the next invoice.

A subscription ties a customer to a particular plan you've created. A subscription still in its trial period is trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over. When payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes past_due . After Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription ends up with a status of either canceled or unpaid depending on your retry settings. Note that when a subscription has a status of unpaid , no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed.

Using a value other than the default is allowed, as a string in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. For example, you can specify \"2020-03-02\" to use that API version: STRIPE_API_VERSION = \"2020-03-02\" However you do so at your own risk, as using a value other than the default might result in incompatibilities between Stripe and this library, especially if Stripe has labelled the differences between API versions as \"Major\". Even small differences such as a new enumeration value might cause issues. For this reason it is best to assume that only the default version is supported. For more information on API versioning, see the stripe documentation . See also API Versions . DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD (Introduced in 2.4.0) DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD is a setting introduced in dj-stripe version 2.4.0. You are required to set it in 2.4.0: It does not have a default value. In 3.0.0, the default will be \"id\", and we recommend setting it to \"id\" for new installations. Older installations should set it to \"djstripe_id\". Explanation below. In dj-stripe 2.3 and before, foreign keys for Stripe models were set to point to the foreign model's djstripe_id field, a numeric integer generated by the local database. This new setting allows dj-stripe users to change it to use the \"id\" field, which is the upstream, non-numeric Stripe identifier. When using the Stripe identifier as a foreign key, synchronization between Stripe and dj-stripe can be made far more efficient and robust. Furthermore, it removes the per-installation instability of a critical value. The plan is to get rid of djstripe_id altogether for the 3.0 release (we may retain the field itself until 4.0, but it will no longer be a primary key). How to migrate older installations from \"djstripe_id\" to \"id\"? Such a migration path has not been designed at the moment. Currently if you want to switch an older installation to \"id\", the easiest way is to wipe the djstripe db and sync again from scratch. This is obviously not ideal, and we will design a proper migration path before 3.0. DJSTRIPE_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CALLBACK (=djstripe.settings.djstripe_settings._get_idempotency_key) A function which will return an idempotency key for a particular object_type and action pair. By default, this is set to a function which will create a djstripe.IdempotencyKey object and return its uuid . You may want to customize this if you want to give your idempotency keys a different lifecycle than they normally would get. The function takes the following signature: def get_idempotency_key ( object_type : str , action : str , livemode : bool ): return \"<idempotency key>\" The function MUST return a string suitably random for the object_type/action pair, and usable in the Stripe Idempotency-Key HTTP header. For more information, see the stripe documentation . DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY (=False) Warning This setting is deprecated and will be removed in dj-stripe 2.8. By default, plans are not prorated in dj-stripe. Concretely, this is how this translates: If a customer cancels their plan during a trial, the cancellation is effective right away. If a customer cancels their plan outside of a trial, their subscription remains active until the subscription's period end, and they do not receive a refund. If a customer switches from one plan to another, the new plan becomes effective right away, and the customer is billed for the new plan's amount. Assigning True to DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY reverses the functioning of item 2 (plan cancellation) by making a cancellation effective right away and refunding the unused balance to the customer, and affects the functioning of item 3 (plan change) by prorating the previous customer's plan towards their new plan's amount. DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY (=\"djstripe_subscriber\") Every Customer object created in Stripe is tagged with metadata This setting controls what the name of the key in Stripe should be. The key name must be a string no more than 40 characters long. You may set this to None or \"\" to disable that behaviour altogether. This is probably not something you want to do, though. DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL (=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL) If the AUTH_USER_MODEL doesn't represent the object your application's subscription holder, you may define a subscriber model to use here. It should be a string in the form of 'app.model'. Note DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL must have an email field. If your existing model has no email field, add an email property that defines an email address to use. Example Model: class Organization ( models . Model ): name = CharField ( max_length = 200 , unique = True ) admin = ForeignKey ( settings . AUTH_USER_MODEL , on_delete = CASCADE ) @property def email ( self ): return self . admin . email DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL_MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY (=\"__first__\") If the model referenced in DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL is not created in the __first__ migration of an app you can specify the migration name to depend on here. For example: \"0003_here_the_subscriber_model_was_added\" DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD (=True) Warning This setting is deprecated and will be removed in dj-stripe 2.8. When set to False , forces dj-stripe to use the jsonfield library for JSONField . Leaving this set to True is highly recommended. However, if you have already migrated with the old fields, migrating to the native JSONField has to be done manually and is not currently natively supported by dj-stripe. The native Django JSONField uses the postgres jsonb column type, which efficiently stores JSON and can be queried far moreconveniently. Django also supports querying JSONField with the ORM. DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL (=r\"^webhook/$\") Warning This setting is deprecated and will be removed in dj-stripe 2.9. This is where you can tell Stripe to send webhook responses. You can set this to what you want to prevent unnecessary hijinks from unfriendly people. As this is embedded in the URLConf, this must be a resolvable regular expression. DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (=\"\") If this is set to a non-empty value, webhook signatures will be verified. Learn more about webhook signature verification . DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_VALIDATION= (=\"verify_signature\") This setting controls which type of validation is done on webhooks. Value can be \"verify_signature\" for signature verification (recommended default), \"retrieve_event\" for event retrieval (makes an extra HTTP request), or None for no validation at all. DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE (=300) Controls the milliseconds tolerance which wards against replay attacks. Leave this to its default value unless you know what you're doing. DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_EVENT_CALLBACK (=None) Webhook event callbacks allow an application to take control of what happens when an event from Stripe is received. It must be a callable or importable string to a callable that takes an event object. One suggestion is to put the event onto a task queue (such as celery) for asynchronous processing. Examples: # callbacks.py def webhook_event_callback ( event , api_key ): \"\"\" Dispatches the event to celery for processing. \"\"\" from . import tasks # Ansychronous hand-off to celery so that we can continue immediately tasks . process_webhook_event . s ( event . pk ) . apply_async () # tasks.py from djstripe.models import WebhookEventTrigger from stripe.error import StripeError @shared_task ( bind = True ) def process_webhook_event ( self , pk ): \"\"\" Processes events from Stripe asynchronously. \"\"\" logger . info ( f \"Processing Stripe event: { pk } \" ) try : # get the event obj = WebhookEventTrigger . objects . get ( pk = pk ) # process the event. # internally, this creates a Stripe WebhookEvent Object and invokes the respective Webhooks event = obj . process () except StripeError as exc : logger . error ( f \"Failed to process Stripe event: { pk } . Retrying in 60 seconds.\" ) raise self . retry ( exc = exc , countdown = 60 ) # retry after 60 seconds except WebhookEventTrigger .

You are required to set it in 2.4.0: It does not have a default value. In 3.0.0, the default will be \"id\", and we recommend setting it to \"id\" for new installations. Older installations should set it to \"djstripe_id\". Explanation below. In dj-stripe 2.3 and before, foreign keys for Stripe models were set to point to the foreign model's djstripe_id field, a numeric integer generated by the local database. This new setting allows dj-stripe users to change it to use the \"id\" field, which is the upstream, non-numeric Stripe identifier. When using the Stripe identifier as a foreign key, synchronization between Stripe and dj-stripe can be made far more efficient and robust. Furthermore, it removes the per-installation instability of a critical value. The plan is to get rid of djstripe_id altogether for the 3.0 release (we may retain the field itself until 4.0, but it will no longer be a primary key). How to migrate older installations from \"djstripe_id\" to \"id\"? Such a migration path has not been designed at the moment. Currently if you want to switch an older installation to \"id\", the easiest way is to wipe the djstripe db and sync again from scratch. This is obviously not ideal, and we will design a proper migration path before 3.0.","title":"DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD"},{"location":"reference/settings/#djstripe_idempotency_key_callback-djstripesettingsdjstripe_settings_get_idempotency_key","text":"A function which will return an idempotency key for a particular object_type and action pair.

Create a new webhook endpoint from the Django administration by going to dj-stripe -> Webhook endpoints -> Add webhook endpoint (or /admin/djstripe/webhookendpoint/add/ ). From there, you can choose an account to create the endpoint for. If no account is chosen, the default Stripe API key will be used to create the endpoint. You can also choose to create the endpoint in test mode or live mode. You may want to change the base URL of the endpoint. This field will be prefilled with the current site. If you're running on the local development server, you may see http://localhost:8000 or similar in there. Stripe won't let you save webhook endpoints with such a value, so you will want to change it to a real website URL. When saved from the admin, the endpoint will be created in Stripe with a dj-stripe specific UUID which will be part of the URL, making it impossible to guess externally by brute-force. Legacy setup Before dj-stripe 2.7.0, dj-stripe included a global webhook endpoint URL, which uses the setting DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET to validate incoming webhooks. This is not recommended as it makes the URL guessable, and may be removed in the future. Extra configuration dj-stripe provides the following settings to tune how your webhooks work: DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_VALIDATION DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_EVENT_CALLBACK Advanced usage dj-stripe comes with native support for webhooks as event listeners. Events allow you to do things like sending an email to a customer when his payment has failed or trial period is ending. This is how you use them: from djstripe import webhooks @webhooks . handler ( \"customer.subscription.trial_will_end\" ) def my_handler ( event , ** kwargs ): print ( \"We should probably notify the user at this point\" ) You can handle all events related to customers like this: from djstripe import webhooks @webhooks . handler ( \"customer\" ) def my_handler ( event , ** kwargs ): print ( \"We should probably notify the user at this point\" ) You can also handle different events in the same handler: from djstripe import webhooks @webhooks . handler ( \"price\" , \"product\" ) def my_handler ( event , ** kwargs ): print ( \"Triggered webhook \" + event . type ) Warning In order to get registrations picked up, you need to put them in a module that is imported like models.py or make sure you import it manually. Webhook event creation and processing is now wrapped in a transaction.atomic() block to better handle webhook errors. This will prevent any additional database modifications you may perform in your custom handler from being committed should something in the webhook processing chain fail. You can also take advantage of Django's transaction.on_commit() function to only perform an action if the transaction successfully commits (meaning the Event processing worked): from django.db import transaction from djstripe import webhooks def do_something (): pass # send a mail, invalidate a cache, fire off a Celery task, etc. @webhooks . handler ( \"price\" , \"product\" ) def my_handler ( event , ** kwargs ): transaction . on_commit ( do_something ) Official documentation Stripe docs for types of Events: https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types Stripe docs for Webhooks: https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks Django docs for transactions: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/transactions/#performing-actions-after-commit","title":"Using Stripe Webhooks"},{"location":"usage/webhooks/#using-stripe-webhooks","text":"","title":"Using Stripe Webhooks"},{"location":"usage/webhooks/#setting-up-a-new-webhook-endpoint-in-dj-stripe","text":"As of dj-stripe 2.7.0, dj-stripe can create its own webhook endpoints on Stripe from the Django administration.
