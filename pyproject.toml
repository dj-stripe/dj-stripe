# flake8 = ">=5.0.4"
# Why is flake8 commented out?
# The short version: flake8 is pinned to an old version of importlib-metadata
# which clashes with other dependencies (such as mkdocs in our case).
#
# For the longer version, you have to look at these links:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/pull/1438
# https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1474
# https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1503
# https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1522
# https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1526
#
# So the flake8 team ran into a deprecation path they didn't like, and got so
# upset about it that… it seems they just decided to never unpin it, even though
# the maintainers of importlib-metadata have since fixed the issue flake8 was
# complaining about.
#
# Now, they're getting issue, after issue, after issue opened on Github because:
# - importlib-metadata 4.4+ is required by many popular libs (markdown, sphinx…)
# - The pin looks unnecessary at first glance
# - They don't document the reasoning for their choice
# - There probably ISN'T any valid reasoning for their choice
# - They are closing & locking any reference to this as off-topic
# - They refuse to address the issue, and complain about anyone who brings it up.
#
# The reasonable approach would of course be to remove the useless pin, but by
# doing so they fear they would "increase the maintenance burden" because they're
# a small team (in other words, they're worried about more bug tracker activity).
# Obviously this makes zero sense since the issue is gone, and they are instead
# generating lots of bug tracker activity, which they're promptly ignoring.
#
# So they're wasting my time, and everybody else's, including yours who's reading
# this little rant right now. But I'd like this to serve as a lesson on how not
# to maintain a popular open source project.
# Many OSS devs are finding out that, with increased popularity comes increased
# responsibility. If you don't want the responsibility, you are not forced to
# continue maintaining the library; but as long as you do, your reach puts you in
# a position of power.
# Wasting your users' time is abusing that position of power.
# Think of the underpaid bureaucrat who, by the stroke of a pen, makes or breaks
# the lives of others. Who was a little too grumpy at work and decided to take it
# out on someone and waste hours of their life by making illogical demands, just
# out of spite.
#
# I'm grateful flake8 exists. But it's not a useful enough tool to allow it to
# waste our time like this, and it's largely been displaced by the other tools:
# mypy, isort, and black. So let's stick to those instead.
