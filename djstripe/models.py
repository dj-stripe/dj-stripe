    1) validate the receipt of a webhook event by doing an event get using the
       API version of the received hook event.
    2) retrieve the referenced object (e.g. the Charge, the Customer, etc) using
       the plugin's supported API version.
    3) process that event using the retrieved object which will, only now, be in
       a format that you are certain to understand

    Invoices are statements of what a customer owes for a particular billing
    period, including subscriptions, invoice items, and any automatic proration
    adjustments if necessary.

    Once an invoice is created, payment is automatically attempted. Note that
    the payment, while automatic, does not happen exactly at the time of invoice
    creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice will wait until one
    hour after the last webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times
    out after failing).

    Any customer credit on the account is applied before determining how much is
    due for that invoice (the amount that will be actually charged).
    If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a
    charge), we add the amount to the customer's running account balance to be
    added to the next invoice. If this amount is negative, it will act as a
    credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance
    does not include unpaid invoices; it only includes balances that need to be
    taken into account when calculating the amount due for the next invoice.
