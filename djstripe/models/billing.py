    Invoices are statements of what a customer owes for a particular billing

    Once an invoice is created, payment is automatically attempted. Note that
    the payment, while automatic, does not happen exactly at the time of invoice
    creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice will wait until one
    hour after the last webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times
    out after failing).

    Any customer credit on the account is applied before determining how much is
    due for that invoice (the amount that will be actually charged).
    If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a
    charge), we add the amount to the customer's running account balance to be
    added to the next invoice. If this amount is negative, it will act as a
    credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance
    does not include unpaid invoices; it only includes balances that need to be
    taken into account when calculating the amount due for the next invoice.

    Subscriptions allow you to charge a customer's card on a recurring basis.
    A subscription ties a customer to a particular plan you've created.

    A subscription still in its trial period is ``trialing`` and moves to ``active``
    when the trial period is over.

    When payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes ``past_due``.
    After Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription ends up
    with a status of either ``canceled`` or ``unpaid`` depending on your retry settings.

    Note that when a subscription has a status of ``unpaid``, no subsequent invoices
    will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately
    automatically closed.

    Additionally, updating customer card details will not lead to Stripe retrying the
    latest invoice.).
    After receiving updated card details from a customer, you may choose to reopen and
