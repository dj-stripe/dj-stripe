    Invoices are statements of what a customer owes for a particular billing

    Once an invoice is created, payment is automatically attempted. Note that
    the payment, while automatic, does not happen exactly at the time of invoice
    creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice will wait until one
    hour after the last webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times
    out after failing).

    Any customer credit on the account is applied before determining how much is
    due for that invoice (the amount that will be actually charged).
    If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a
    charge), we add the amount to the customer's running account balance to be
    added to the next invoice. If this amount is negative, it will act as a
    credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance
    does not include unpaid invoices; it only includes balances that need to be
