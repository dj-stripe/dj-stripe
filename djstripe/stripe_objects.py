.. module:: djstripe.stripe_objects
   :synopsis: dj-stripe - Abstract model definitions to provide our view of Stripe's objects

.. moduleauthor:: Bill Huneke (@wahuneke)
.. moduleauthor:: Alex Kavanaugh (@kavdev)
.. moduleauthor:: Lee Skillen (@lskillen)

This module is an effort to isolate (as much as possible) the API dependent code in one
place. Primarily this is:

1) create models containing the fields that we care about, mapping to Stripe's fields
2) create methods for consistently syncing our database with Stripe's version of the objects
3) centralized methods for creating new database records to match incoming Stripe objects

This module defines abstract models which are then extended in models.py to provide the remaining
dj-stripe functionality.

is:

    1) validate the receipt of a webhook event by doing an event get using the API version of the received hook event.

Invoices are statements of what a customer owes for a particular billing period, including subscriptions,
invoice items, and any automatic proration adjustments if necessary.

Once an invoice is created, payment is automatically attempted. Note that the payment, while automatic,
does not happen exactly at the time of invoice creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice
will wait until one hour after the last webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times out after failing).

Any customer credit on the account is applied before determining how much is due for that invoice (the amount that
will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a charge), we
add the amount to the customer's running account balance to be added to the next invoice. If this amount is negative,
it will act as a credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance does not include unpaid
invoices; it only includes balances that need to be taken into account when calculating the amount due for the next
invoice.

Subscriptions allow you to charge a customer's card on a recurring basis. A subscription ties a

A subscription still in its trial period is ``trialing`` and moves to ``active`` when the trial period is over.
When payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes ``past_due``. After Stripe has exhausted
all payment retry attempts, the subscription ends up with a status of either ``canceled`` or ``unpaid`` depending
on your retry settings. Note that when a subscription has a status of ``unpaid``, no subsequent invoices will be
attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed. Additionally, updating customer
card details will not lead to Stripe retrying the latest invoice.). After receiving updated card details from a
customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
