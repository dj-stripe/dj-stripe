A note on Stripe Elements JS methods
====================================

.. note::
  TLDR: If you haven't yet migrated to PaymentIntents,
  prefer ``stripe.createSource()`` over ``stripe.createToken()`` for better compatibility with PaymentMethods.


A point that can cause confusion when integrating Stripe on the web is that there
are multiple generations of frontend JS APIs that use Stripe Elements with stripe js v3.

In descending order of preference these are:

Payment Intents (SCA compliant)
-------------------------------

The newest and preferred way of handling payments, which supports SCA compliance (3D secure etc).

See https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents/web


Charges using stripe.createSource()
-----------------------------------

This creates Source objects within Stripe, and can be used for various different
methods of payment (including, but not limited to cards), but isn't SCA compliant.

See https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-source

The `Card Elements Quickstart JS`_ example can be used, except use ``stripe.createSource`` instead of ``stripe.createToken``
and the ``result.source``  instead of ``result.token``.

See https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/blob/master/tests/apps/example/templates/purchase_subscription.html
in for a working example of this.


Charges using stripe.createToken()
----------------------------------

This predates ``stripe.createSource``, and creates legacy Card objects within Stripe,
which have some compatibility issues with Payment Methods.

If you're using ``stripe.createToken``, see if you can upgrade to ``stripe.createSource``
or ideally to Payment Intents .
