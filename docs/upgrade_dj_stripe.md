# Upgrading dj-stripe Smooth and Carefully

## Background

In this article, we will share how to upgrade the `dj-stripe` package flawlessly and carefully.

!! attention "Important Note"
    Please keep in mind that `dj-stripe` always squashes the migration files.
    Which means its migration files are completely changed, and leading to migration issues.
    **So, you can't immediately upgrade your package too far, for example, from `2.4.0` to `2.7.0` because it will cause breaking changes, especially in your database migrations.**


## How to do it?

For example, if your `dj-stripe` version is `2.4.0` and your migration files are referring to the old version.

![old migration file](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io/assets/7134451/d433d048-d3cf-4385-a7f6-f1890acfe206)

First, you need to find which version has that old migration. For example:

1. Search for the latest version that is closest to your package version, for example: `2.4.0` to `2.5.0`.
2. Visit this link to find it: https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/tags
3. Cross-check the release notes.
4. Find which dj-stripe version is still compatible with your migration file, for example: `0006_2_3.py`.
5. Find the last migration file of the latest version at https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/tree/2.5.0/djstripe/migrations (for example: `0008_2_5.py`) (both files must exist; if not, it means the new version is no longer compatible with your version).

| Old Migration | New Migration |
| ------------- | ------------- |

6. Update your `requirements.txt` file from `dj-stripe==2.4.0` to `dj-stripe==2.5.0`
7. Run the `manage.py migrate djstripe` command _(this command must not fail; if it does, cross-check steps 1-6)._

```console

System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (djstripe.W001) The Stripe API version has a non-default value of '2024-04-10'. Non-default versions are not explicitly supported, and may cause compatibility issues.
	HINT: Use the dj-stripe default for Stripe API version: 2020-08-27
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: djstripe
Running migrations:
  Applying djstripe.0008_2_5... OK
```

8. And then, after migrating it, change your migration file to refer to the new version (e.g., from `0006_2_3` to `0008_2_5`).

9. Repeat the same process for higher version.


If you have an issue with the Stripe version, we can also try upgrading it in the `requirements.txt` file. \
Check out this issue for more information: https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/1842#issuecomment-1319185657.

```
stripe>=4.0.0,<5.0.0  # https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/1842#issuecomment-1319185657
```


### Conclusion

1. Find the closest version that compatible with your version _(for doing migration)_.
2. Update the dependency in `requirements.txt` file and then deploy it.
   - Don't forget to run the `python manage.py migrate djstripe` command.
3. Change your migration file to refer to the new version (e.g., from `0006_2_3` to `0008_2_5`), and then deploy it.
