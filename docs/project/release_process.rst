Release Process
===============

.. contents::


.. Attention:: Before ``MAJOR`` or ``MINOR`` releases:

	* Review deprecation notes (eg search for "deprecated") and remove deprecated features as appropriate
	* Squash migrations (ONLY on unreleased migrations) - see below

.. _squash_migrations:

Squash migrations
-----------------

If there's more than one unreleased migration on master consider squashing them with ``squashmigrations``,
immediately before tagging the new release:

* Create a new squashed migration with ``./manage.py squashmigrations`` (only squash migrations that have never been in a tagged release)
* Commit the squashed migration on master with a commit message like "Squash x.y.0dev migrations" (this will allow users who running master to safely upgrade, see note below about rc package)
* Then transition the squashed migration to a normal migration as per Django:
	* Delete all the migration files it replaces
	* Update all migrations that depend on the deleted migrations to depend on the squashed migration instead
	* Remove the ``replaces`` attribute in the Migration class of the squashed migration (this is how Django tells that it is a squashed migration)
* Commit these changes to master with a message like "Transition squashed migration to normal migration"
* Then do the normal release process - bump version as another commit and tag the release

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing

Tag + package squashed migrations as rc package (optional)
----------------------------------------------------------

As a convenience to users who are running master, an rc version can be created to
package the squashed migration.

To do this, immediately after the "Squash x.y.0dev migrations" commit, follow the
steps below but with a x.y.0rc0 version to tag and package a rc version.

Users who have been using the x.y.0dev code from master can then run the squashed
migrations migrations before upgrading to >=x.y.0.

The simplest way to do this is to ``pip install dj-stripe==x.y.0rc0`` and migrate,
or alternatively check out the ``x.y.0rc0`` git tag and migrate.

Prepare changes for the release commit
--------------------------------------

* Choose your version number (using https://semver.org/  )
	* if there's a new migration, it should be a ``MAJOR.0.0`` or ``MAJOR.MINOR.0`` version.
* Review and update ``HISTORY.rst``
	* Add a section for this release version
	* Set date on this release version
	* Check that summary of feature/fixes is since the last release is up to date
* Update package version number in ``setup.cfg``
* Review and update supported API version in ``README.rst``
	(this is the most recent Stripe account version tested against, not ``DEFAULT_STRIPE_API_VERSION``)
* ``git add`` to stage these changes

Create signed release commit tag
--------------------------------

.. Note:: Before doing this you should have a GPG key set up on github

	If you don't have a GPG key already, one method is via https://keybase.io/ , and then add it to your github profile.

* Create a release tag with the above staged changes (where ``$VERSION`` is the version number to be released::

	$ git commit -m "Release $VERSION"
	$ git tag -fsm "Release $VERSION" $VERSION

This can be expressed as a bash function as follows::

	git_release() { git commit -m "Release $1" && git tag -fsm "Release $1" $1; }

* Push the commit and tag::

	$ git push --follow-tags

Update/create stable branch
---------------------------

Push these changes to the appropriate ``stable/MAJOR.MINOR`` version branch (eg ``stable/2.0``) if they're not already - note that this will trigger the readthedocs build

Configure readthedocs
---------------------

If this is this is a new stable branch then do the following on https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/dj-stripe/versions/

* Find the new ``stable/MAJOR.MINOR`` branch name and mark it as active (and then save).
