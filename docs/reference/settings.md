## STRIPE_API_VERSION (='2020-08-27')

The API version used to communicate with the Stripe API is configurable, and defaults to
the latest version that has been tested as working. Using a value other than the default
is allowed, as a string in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.

For example, you can specify `"2020-03-02"` to use that API version:

```py
STRIPE_API_VERSION = "2020-03-02"
```

However you do so at your own risk, as using a value other than the default might result
in incompatibilities between Stripe and this library, especially if Stripe has labelled
the differences between API versions as "Major". Even small differences such as a new
enumeration value might cause issues.

For this reason it is best to assume that only the default version is supported.

For more information on API versioning, see the [stripe
documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades).

## DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD

_(Introduced in 2.4.0)_

`DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD` is a setting introduced in dj-stripe version 2.4.0. You
are required to set it in 2.4.0: It does not have a default value. In 3.0.0, the default
will be "id", and we recommend setting it to "id" for new installations. Older
installations should set it to "djstripe_id". Explanation below.

In dj-stripe 2.3 and before, foreign keys for Stripe models were set to point to the
foreign model's djstripe_id field, a numeric integer generated by the local database.
This new setting allows dj-stripe users to change it to use the "id" field, which is the
upstream, non-numeric Stripe identifier.

When using the Stripe identifier as a foreign key, synchronization between Stripe and
dj-stripe can be made far more efficient and robust. Furthermore, it removes the
per-installation instability of a critical value. The plan is to get rid of djstripe_id
altogether for the 3.0 release (we may retain the field itself until 4.0, but it will no
longer be a primary key).

**How to migrate older installations from "djstripe_id" to "id"?**

Such a migration path has not been designed at the moment. Currently if you want to
switch an older installation to "id", the easiest way is to wipe the djstripe db and
sync again from scratch. This is obviously not ideal, and we will design a proper
migration path before 3.0.

## DJSTRIPE_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CALLBACK (=djstripe.settings.djstripe_settings.\_get_idempotency_key)

A function which will return an idempotency key for a particular object_type and action
pair. By default, this is set to a function which will create a
`djstripe.IdempotencyKey` object and return its `uuid`. You may want to customize this
if you want to give your idempotency keys a different lifecycle than they normally would
get.

The function takes the following signature:

```py
def get_idempotency_key(object_type: str, action: str, livemode: bool):
    return "<idempotency key>"
```

The function MUST return a string suitably random for the object_type/action pair, and
usable in the Stripe `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header. For more information, see the
[stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades).

## DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY (=False)

By default, plans are not prorated in dj-stripe. Concretely, this is how this
translates:

1.  If a customer cancels their plan during a trial, the cancellation is effective right
    away.
2.  If a customer cancels their plan outside of a trial, their subscription remains
    active until the subscription's period end, and they do not receive a refund.
3.  If a customer switches from one plan to another, the new plan becomes effective
    right away, and the customer is billed for the new plan's amount.

Assigning `True` to `DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY` reverses the functioning of item 2 (plan
cancellation) by making a cancellation effective right away and refunding the unused
balance to the customer, and affects the functioning of item 3 (plan change) by
prorating the previous customer's plan towards their new plan's amount.

## DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_EXCEPTION_URLS (=())

!!! warning

    This functionality is deprecated.

Used by `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`

Rules:

-   "(app_name)" means everything from this app is exempt
-   "\[namespace\]" means everything with this name is exempt
-   "namespace:name" means this namespaced URL is exempt
-   "name" means this URL is exempt
-   The entire djstripe namespace is exempt
-   If settings.DEBUG is True, then django-debug-toolbar is exempt

Example:

```py
DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_EXCEPTION_URLS = (
    "(allauth)",  # anything in the django-allauth URLConf
    "[blogs]",  # Anything in the blogs namespace
    "products:detail",  # A ProductDetail view you want shown to non-payers
    "home",  # Site homepage
)
```

!!! note

    Adding app_names to applications.

    To make the `(allauth)` work, you may need to define an app_name in the
    `include()` function in the URLConf. For example:

    ```py
        # in urls.py
        url(r'^accounts/', include('allauth.urls',  app_name="allauth")),
    ```

## DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY (="djstripe_subscriber")

Every Customer object created in Stripe is tagged with
[metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/api#metadata) This setting controls what the name of
the key in Stripe should be. The key name must be a string no more than 40 characters
long.

You may set this to `None` or `""` to disable that behaviour altogether. This is
probably not something you want to do, though.

## DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL (=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)

If the AUTH_USER_MODEL doesn't represent the object your application's subscription
holder, you may define a subscriber model to use here. It should be a string in the form
of 'app.model'.

!!! note

    DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL must have an `email` field. If your
    existing model has no email field, add an email property that
    defines an email address to use.

Example Model:

```py
class Organization(models.Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    admin = ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=CASCADE)

    @property
    def email(self):
        return self.admin.email
```

## DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL_MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY (="\_\_first\_\_")

If the model referenced in DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL is not created in the `__first__`
migration of an app you can specify the migration name to depend on here. For example:
"0003_here_the_subscriber_model_was_added"

## DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD (=False)

Setting this to `True` will make the various dj-stripe JSON fields use the native Django
`JSONField` model instead of the `jsonfield` library.

**On Django 3.0 and older**: The `django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField` field will
always be used. A Postgres backend is required (uses
[jsonb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-json.html) internally).

**On Django 3.1 and newer**: `django.models.JSONField` will always be used. This field
type is compatible with all database backends.

Setting this to True is highly recommended. However, if you have already migrated with
the old fields, migrating to the native JSONField has to be done manually and is not
currently supported by dj-stripe. We will eventaully move to exclusively using the
native JSONField.

The native Django JSONField uses the postgres `jsonb` column type, which efficiently
stores JSON and can be queried far moreconveniently. Django also supports [querying
JSONField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#querying-jsonfield)
with the ORM.

## DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL (=r"^webhook/$")

This is where you can tell Stripe to send webhook responses. You can set this to what
you want to prevent unnecessary hijinks from unfriendly people.

As this is embedded in the URLConf, this must be a resolvable regular expression.

## DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (="")

If this is set to a non-empty value, webhook signatures will be verified.

[Learn more about webhook signature
verification](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures).

## DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_VALIDATION= (="verify_signature")

This setting controls which type of validation is done on webhooks. Value can be
`"verify_signature"` for signature verification (recommended default),
`"retrieve_event"` for event retrieval (makes an extra HTTP request), or `None` for no
validation at all.

## DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE (=300)

Controls the milliseconds tolerance which wards against replay attacks. Leave this to
its default value unless you know what you're doing.

## DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_EVENT_CALLBACK (=None)

Webhook event callbacks allow an application to take control of what happens when an
event from Stripe is received. It must be a callable or importable string to a callable
that takes an event object.

One suggestion is to put the event onto a task queue (such as celery) for asynchronous
processing.

Examples:

```py
# callbacks.py
def webhook_event_callback(event):
    """ Dispatches the event to celery for processing. """
    from . import tasks
    # Ansychronous hand-off to celery so that we can continue immediately
    tasks.process_webhook_event.s(event.pk).apply_async()
```

```py
# tasks.py
from djstripe.models import WebhookEventTrigger
from stripe.error import StripeError

@shared_task(bind=True)
def process_webhook_event(self, pk):
    """ Processes events from Stripe asynchronously. """
    logger.info(f"Processing Stripe event: {pk}")
    try:
        # get the event
        obj = WebhookEventTrigger.objects.get(pk=pk)
        # process the event.
        # internally, this creates a Stripe WebhookEvent Object and invokes the respective Webhooks
        event = obj.process()
    except StripeError as exc:
        logger.error(f"Failed to process Stripe event: {pk}. Retrying in 60 seconds.")
        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=60)  # retry after 60 seconds
    except WebhookEventTrigger.DoesNotExist as exc:
        # This can happen in case the celery task got executed before the actual model got saved to the DB
        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=10)  # retry after 10 seconds

    return event.type or "Stripe Event Processed"
```

```py
# settings.py
DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_EVENT_CALLBACK = 'callbacks.webhook_event_callback'
```

## STRIPE_API_HOST (= unset)

If set, this sets the base API host for Stripe. You may want to set this to, for
example, `"http://localhost:12111"` if you are running
[stripe-mock](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock).

If this is set in production (DEBUG=False), a warning will be raised on `manage.py check`.
