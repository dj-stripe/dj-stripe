# What is dj-stripe?

Dj-stripe is an extensible wrapper around the Stripe API that continuously syncs most of the Stripe Data to your local database as pre-implemented Django Models, out of the box! This allows you to use the Django ORM, in your code, to work with the data making it easier and faster!

For example, if you need to interact with a customer subscription, you can use **dj-stripe’s Subscription Model**, in your code, to get the subscription data for that customer as well as the related models’ data too (if need be and **potentially in 1 database query!**) instead of making multiple slower and unreliable consecutive network calls only to parse through 1 or more of Stripe’s JSON like objects!
