A note on Stripe API versions
=============================

A point that can cause confusion to new users of dj-stripe is that there are several different Stripe API versions
in play at once.

In brief:  Don't touch the ``STRIPE_API_VERSION`` setting, but don't worry, it doesn't need to match your Stripe account api version.

See also https://stripe.com/docs/api/versioning

Your Stripe account's API version
----------------------------------

You can find this on your Stripe dashboard labelled "default" here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers

For new accounts this will be the latest Stripe version.  When upgrading version Stripe only allows you to upgrade to
the latest version.  See https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api

This is the version used by Stripe when sending webhook data to you (though during webhook processing, dj-stripe
re-fetches the data with its preferred version).  It's also the and it's the default version used by the Stripe API, but
dj-stripe overrides the API version when talking to stripe (this override is triggered on import of ``djstripe.models``).

As a result your Stripe account API version is mostly irrelevant, though from time to time we will increase the
minimum supported API version, and it's good practise to regularly upgrade to the latest version with appropriate testing.


Stripe's current latest API version
-----------------------------------

You can find this on your Stripe dashboard labelled "latest" or in Stripe's API documentation, eg https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog

This is the version used by new accounts and it's also "true" internal version of Stripe's API - see  https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning


dj-stripe's API version
-----------------------

This is the Stripe API version used by dj-stripe in all communication with Stripe, including when processing webhooks
(though webhook data is sent to you by Stripe with your API version, we re-fetch the data with dj-stripe's API version),
this is because the API schema needs to match dj-stripe's Django model schema.

This is defined by ``djstripe.settings.DEFAULT_STRIPE_API_VERSION`` and :ref:`can be overridden <setting_stripe_api_version>`,
though see the warning about doing this.


dj-stripe's tested version (as mentioned in README)
---------------------------------------------------

This is the most recent Stripe account API version used by the maintainers during testing, more recent versions account
versions are probably fine though.
