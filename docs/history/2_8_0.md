!!! attention

    It is not possible to upgrade to dj-stripe 2.8.0 from versions older than 2.5.0.
    To upgrade from an older version, first upgrade to dj-stripe 2.5.0.

## Release highlights

This release introduces support for Stripe Identity.

It is also slated to be the last major release before dj-stripe 3.0, which will introduce
significant, backwards-incompatible changes.

-   Python 3.11 is now supported.
-   Django 4.1 and 4.2 are now supported.
-   Python 3.7 is no longer supported. Python 3.8 or higher is required.
-   Added `LineItem` model.
-   Added `Discount` model.
-   Added `SourceTransaction`, `VerificationSession` and `VerificationReport` models.

## Deprecated features

-   `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_EVENT_CALLBACK` is deprecated in favour of the new webhook signals.
-   `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE` is deprecated in favour of the new UUID webhooks `tolerance` model field.


## Breaking changes

-   Remove legacy JSONField support. This drops support for installations with the
    `DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD` setting set to `False`.
    NOTE: No migration path is available yet.
    https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/1820
-   Remove `djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe` command (deprecated in 2.4.0).
    Use `djstripe_sync_models price` instead.
-   Remove `Customer.can_charge()`, `Customer.has_valid_source()` ()
-   Remove `DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY` setting (deprecated in 2.6.0)
-   Remove deprecated `prorate` argument to `Subscription.update()` (Use Stripe's
    `proration_behavior` argument instead)
-   Remove undocumented `set_stripe_api_version()` helper function
    and context manager `stripe_temporary_api_version()`.
    The API version is now set on each request individually.
-   Updated `Charge.refund(...)` helper function
    to correctly create the desired refund. Note that the
    created `Refund` object is now returned as opposed to
    the `Charge` object.
-   Resolved ambiguity between `LineItem` and `InvoiceItem` models. We previously
    assumed that the `lines` List object on `Invoice` and `UpcomingInvoice` models only
    return `InvoiceItem` objects. Moreover `LineItem` objects can also be of type
    `subscription` if the user adds a Subscription to their `Invoice` as a lineitem.

## Other changes

-   Updated the Stripe API key and webhook django system check to warning instead of critical.
-   Added various missing model field to CheckoutSession and Payout models.
-   Added support for running tests using the real Stripe API calls.
-   `stripe.api_version` is no longer manipulated by dj-stripe.
-   New webhook signals are available:
    -   `djstripe.signals.webhook_pre_validate(instance, api_key)`: Fired before webhook validation
    -   `djstripe.signals.webhook_post_validate(instance, api_key, valid)`: Fired after validation (even unsuccessful validations)
    -   `djstripe.signals.webhook_pre_process(instance, api_key)`: Fired before webhook processing. Not fired if the validation failed.
    -   `djstripe.signals.webhook_post_process(instance, api_key)`: Fired after webhook successful processing.
-   `djstripe.signals.webhook_processing_error` now also takes `instance` and `api_key` arguments
-   Updated deprecated `pkg_resources` to `importlib`.
-   Updated `Subscription.api_list()` to pass through any value of `status` kwarg.
