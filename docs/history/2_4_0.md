!!! attention

    To upgrade to 2.4.0 from older versions of dj-stripe, scroll down to the [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide).

## Introducing sponsorships and our first sponsor

We're excited to introduce our [Sponsorship
tiers](https://github.com/sponsors/dj-stripe). Individuals may back dj-stripe to assist
with development. Larger backers may choose one the [paid support plans
available](../project/support.md#support_plans) to receive support on top of ensuring the long-term
viability of the project!

And this release was made possible by none other thanâ€¦ [Stripe](https://stripe.com)! Our
very first Gold sponsor. Their financial backing has allowed us to pour a lot of work
that could not have otherwise happened.

## Release notes

-   Support for Django 3.1 and Python 3.8.
-   Minimum stripe-python version is now 2.48.0.
-   Default Stripe API version is now `2020-08-27`.
-   First-class support for the Price model, replacing Plans.
-   Support multi-item subscriptions.
-   Support for API keys in the database (see [Managing Stripe API
    keys](../api_keys.md#managing_stripe_api_keys)).
-   Support for syncing objects for multiple, different Stripe accounts.
-   Use Django 3.1 native JSONField when available.

## New feature: in-database Stripe API keys

Stripe API keys are now stored in the database, and are now editable in the admin.

!!! warning

    By default, all keys are visible by anyone who has access to the dj-stripe
    administration.

### Why?

As we work on supporting multiple Stripe accounts per instance, it is vital for
dj-stripe to have a mechanism to store more than one Stripe API key. It also became
obvious that we may want proper programmatic access to create and delete keys.
Furthermore, API keys are a legitimate upstream Stripe object, and it is not unlikely
the API may allow access to listing other API keys in the future, in which case we will
want to move them to the database anyway.

In the next release, we are planning to make WebhookEndpoints (and thus webhook secrets)
manageable via the database as well.

### Do I need to change anything?

Not at this time. The settings `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` can
still be used. Their values will however be automatically saved to the database at the
earliest opportunity.

### What about public keys?

Setting `STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY` will be deprecated next
release. You do not risk anything by leaving them in your settings: They are not used by
Dj-Stripe outside of the Dj-Stripe mixins, which are now themselves deprecated. So you
can safely leave them in your settings, or you can move them to the database as well
(Keys beginning in `pk_test_` and `pk_live_` will be detected as publishable keys).

## Deprecated features

Nobody likes features being removed. However, the last few releases we have had to
remove features that were not core to what dj-stripe does, or simply poorly-maintained.
To keep up with the trend, we are making three major deprecations this release:

### Creating Plans from the Django Admin is no longer supported

The `Plan` model was special cased in various places, including being the only one which
supported being created from the Django administration. This is no longer supported. We
have plans to allow creating arbitrary Stripe objects from the Django Admin, but until
it can be done consistently, we have decided to remove the feature for Plans (which are
deprecated by Stripe anyway). The only object type you should be dealing with from the
admin is the new APIKey model.

Along with this, we are also deprecating the `djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe`
management command. You can instead use the `djstripe_sync_models` management command,
which supports arbitrary models.

### Deprecating the REST API

We are dropping all support for the REST API and will be fully removing it in 2.5.0.
We're doing this because we wish to keep such an API separate from dj-stripe. Work has
already started on a new project, and we will be sharing more details about it soon. If
you're interested in helping out, please reach out on
[Github](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues/new)!

### Deprecating `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`

Large parts of dj-stripe, including this middleware, were designed before Stripe's major
revamps of the old Plan model into Prices, Products, and multi-plan subscriptions. The
functionality offered by the middleware is no longer adequate, and building on top of it
would not be particularly robust. We may bring similar functionality back in the future,
but the middleware as it is is going away (as well as the undocumented
`djstripe.utils.subscriber_has_active_subscription` utility function).

If you want to keep the functionality for your project, you may wish to [copy the latest
version of the
middleware](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/blob/2.4.0/djstripe/middleware.py).

### Deprecating `djstripe.mixins`

This is being deprecated for similar reasons as the SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware.
However, the mixins module was undocumented and never officially supported.

### Other deprecations

-   The `account` field on `Charge` has been renamed to `on_behalf_of`, to be consistent
    with Stripe's upstream model. Note that this field is separate from
    `djstripe_owner_account`, which is set by dj-stripe itself to match the account of
    the API key used.
-   `Account.get_connected_account_from_token()` is deprecated in favour of
    `Account.get_or_retrieve_for_api_key()`, which supports more than just Connect
    accounts.
-   `Customer.has_active_subscription()` is deprecated in favour of
    `Customer.is_subscribed_to()`. Note that the former takes a plan as argument,
    whereas the latter takes a product as argument.
-   The `tax_percent` attribute of `Invoice` is no longer populated and will be removed
    in 2.5.0. You may want to use `Invoice.default_tax_rates` instead, which uses the
    new TaxId functionality.
-   `Customer.business_vat_id` is being deprecated in favour of using TaxId models
    directly.

## Breaking changes

-   Rename PlanBillingScheme to BillingScheme.
-   Remove `Plan.update_name()` and these previously-deprecated fields:

    -   `Customer.business_vat_id`
    -   `Subscription.start`
    -   `Subscription.billing`

## Upgrade Guide

Before you upgrade to dj-stripe 2.4.0, we recommend upgrading to dj-stripe 2.3.0.
Upgrading one major release at a time minimizes the risk of issues arising.

Upgrading directly to 2.4.0 from dj-stripe versions older than 2.2.0 is unsupported.

To upgrade dj-stripe, run `pip install --upgrade dj-stripe==2.4.0`.

Once installed, you can run `manage.py migrate djstripe` to migrate the database models.

!!! attention

    If you are doing multiple major dj-stripe upgrades in a row, remember to run the
    migrate command after every upgrade. Skipping this step WILL cause errors.

!!! note

    Migrating the database models may take a long time on databases with large amounts of customers.

### Settings changes

A new mandatory setting `DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD` has been added. If you are
upgrading from an older version, you need to set it to `"djstripe_id"`.

Setting it to `"id"` will make dj-stripe use the Stripe IDs as foreign keys. Although
this is recommended for new installations, there is currently no migration available for
going from `"djstripe_id"` to `"id"`.

For more information on this setting, see
[Settings](../reference/settings.md#djstripe_foreign_key_to_field).
