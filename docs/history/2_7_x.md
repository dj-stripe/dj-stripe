# dj-stripe 2.7.3 (2022-11-26)

Due to Stripe dropping support for the `Order` model, we have had to restrict the Stripe
SDK to versions below 5.0.0.

This release thus fixes the following error:

```
AttributeError: module 'stripe' has no attribute 'Order'
```

If you are on an older version of dj-stripe and cannot upgrade, you may simply install
an older version of the Stripe SDK, for example with `pip install stripe<5.0.0`.
