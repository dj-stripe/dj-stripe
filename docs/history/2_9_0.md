# dj-stripe 2.9.0 ()

## Breaking Changes
- Removed deprecated settings `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE`, `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Removed deprecated Order model
- Support for Source and SourceTransaction models has been removed. The models remain
  accessible in the codebase for compatibility, but have to be explicitly imported via
  `djstripe.models.payment_methods`. They will be removed in a future version.
- Remove unsupported method `Customer.add_card`.
- Remove admin support for deprecated `Plan` model.
- Support for legacy webhooks (not stored in the database) has been removed.

## Version support
- The minimum Stripe SDK version is now 8.0.0.
- Support for Python versions older than 3.10 has been dropped.
- Support for Django versions older than 4.2 has been dropped.
- Support for EOL'd versions of Postgres and MariaDB has been dropped.

## Deprecations
- The setting `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_VALIDATION` has been deprecated in favour of the new
  `djstripe_validation_method` field on the WebhookEndpoint model. You may configure it
  through the admin panel on a per-endpoint basis.

## Bugfixes
- Fix issue processing Refund objects for connected accounts
- Default webhook endpoint version to the configured setting
- Fix crash when syncing an invoice with null discounts

## Other changes
- A new `stripe_data` field has been added to all models. This field will contain a copy
  of all the data in the Stripe model, including a duplicated version of most fields.
  This has been done to offer forwards-compatibility with dj-stripe 3.0 which includes
  significant changes to the model structure, and removes the duplicated fields. If you
  are using specific SQL lookups into the djstripe models, we recommend updating those
  to look in the `stripe_data` JSON field to minimize future compatibility updates.
- All enums are now set to 255 max length to fix forwards-compatibility issues.
- Some superfluous and unused admin actions have been removed.
- Added individual tolerance configuration to database webhook.
- The `unique_together` constraint on the `Customer` model has been removed as it was
  causing issues in certain setups. You may add it back via SQL if you do need it.
- Removed a noisy check when configuring a custom stripe api version.
