## Release highlights

-   Webhook Endpoints are now configured via the Django administration.

## Deprecated features

-   The `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL` setting is deprecated. It will be removed in dj-stripe

    longer necessary with the new webhook endpoint system.

## Breaking changes

-   If you are installing directly from source, you now need Poetry 1.2.0 or higher.
-   Remove the deprecated middleware `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`

## Other changes

-   Remove support for the deprecated `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REDIRECT` setting
-   Remove support for the `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_EXCEPTION_URLS` setting
-   Added support for releasing `Subscription Schedules` by using the `SubscriptionSchedule.release()` method.
-   Added support for releasing `Subscription Schedules` from Django-Admin.
-   Added support for cancelling `Subscription Schedules` by using the `SubscriptionSchedule.cancel()` method.
-   Added support for cancelling `Subscription Schedules` from Django-Admin.
