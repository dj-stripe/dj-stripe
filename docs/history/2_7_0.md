!!! attention

    It is not possible to upgrade to dj-stripe 2.7.0 from versions older than 2.4.0.
    To upgrade from an older version, first upgrade to dj-stripe 2.4.0.

This release focuses on Webhook Endpoints. For more information on the reasoning behind
the changes, please see the discussion on Github:

<https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/discussions/1437>

## Release highlights

-   Webhook Endpoints are now configured via the Django administration.
-   Multiple Webhook Endpoints are now supported.
-   Webhook Endpoints now have a unique, non-guessable URL.

## Deprecated features

-   The `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL` setting is deprecated. It will be removed in dj-stripe
    2.9. It was added to give a way of "hiding" the webhook endpoint URL, but that is no
    longer necessary with the new webhook endpoint system.

## Breaking changes

-   Remove the deprecated middleware `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`
-   Remove support for the deprecated `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REDIRECT` setting
-   Remove support for the `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_EXCEPTION_URLS` setting

## Other changes

-   Many Stripe Connect related fixes (Special thanks to Dominik Bartenstein of Zemtu)
-   Allow passing stripe kwargs in Subscription.cancel()
-   Various admin improvements
-   Add support for managing subscription schedules from the admin
