### Warning about safe uninstall of jsonfield2 on upgrade

Both **jsonfield** and **jsonfield2** use the same import path, so if
upgrading from dj-stripe\~=2.2.0 in an existing virtualenv, be sure to
uninstall jsonfield2 first. eg:
```bash

    # ensure jsonfield is uninstalled before we install jsonfield2
    pip uninstall jsonfield2 -y && pip install "dj-stripe>=2.3.0dev"
```

Otherwise, `pip uninstall jsonfield2` will remove jsonfield's
`jsonfield` module from `site-packages`, which would cause errors like
`ImportError: cannot import name 'JSONField' from 'jsonfield' (unknown location)`

If you have hit this ImportError already after upgrading, running this
should resolve it:

```bash
# remove both jsonfield packages before reinstall to fix ImportError:
pip uninstall jsonfield jsonfield2 -y && pip install "dj-stripe>=2.3.0"
```

Note that this is only necessary if upgrading from dj-stripe 2.2.x,
which temporarily depended on jsonfield2. This process is not necessary
if upgrading from an earlier version of dj-stripe.

## 2.2.2 (2020-01-20)

This is a bugfix-only version:

-   Fixed handling of `TaxRate` events (#1094).

## 2.2.1 (2020-01-14)

This is a bugfix-only version:

-   Fixed bad package build.

## 2.2.0 (2020-01-13)

-   Changed `JSONField` dependency package from
    [jsonfield](https://github.com/rpkilby/jsonfield/) to
    [jsonfield2](https://github.com/rpkilby/jsonfield2/), for Django 3
    compatibility (see [Warning about safe uninstall of jsonfield on
    upgrade](#warning-about-safe-uninstall-of-jsonfield-on-upgrade)).
    Note that Django 2.1 requires jsonfield&lt;3.1.
-   Added support for Django 3.0 (requires jsonfield2&gt;=3.0.3).
-   Added support for python 3.8.
-   Refactored `UpcomingInvoice`, so it's no longer a subclass of
    `Invoice` (to allow `Invoice` to use `ManyToManyFields`).
-   Dropped previously-deprecated `Account` fields (see <https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-02-19> ):
    -   `.business_name`
    -   `.business_primary_color`
    -   `.business_url` (changed to a property)
    -   `.debit_negative_balances`
    -   `.decline_charge_on`
    -   `.display_name`
    -   `.legal_entity`
    -   `.payout_schedule`
    -   `.payout_statement_descriptor`
    -   `.statement_descriptor`
    -   `.support_email`
    -   `.support_phone`
    -   `.support_url`
    -   `.timezone`
    -   `.verification`
-   Dropped previously-deprecated `Account.business_logo` property
    (renamed to `.branding_icon`)
-   Dropped previously-deprecated `Customer.account_balance` property
    (renamed to `.balance`)
-   Dropped previously-deprecated properties `Invoice.application_fee`,
    `Invoice.date`
-   Dropped previously-deprecated enum `PaymentMethodType` (use
    `DjstripePaymentMethodType` instead)
-   Renamed `Invoice.billing` to `.collection_method` (added deprecated
    property for the old name).
-   Updated `Invoice` model to add missing fields.
-   Added `TaxRate` model, and `Invoice.default_tax_rates`,
    `InvoiceItem.tax_rates`, `Invoice.total_tax_amounts`,
    `Subscription.default_tax_rates`, `SubscriptionItem.tax_rates`
    (#1027).
-   Change urls.py to use the new style urls.
-   Update forward relation fields in the admin to be raw id fields.
-   Updated `StripeQuantumCurrencyAmountField` and
    `StripeDecimalCurrencyAmountField` to support Stripe Large Charges
    (#1045).
-   Update event handling so `customer.subscription.deleted` updates
    subscriptions to `status="canceled"` instead of deleting it from our
    database, to match Stripe's behaviour (#599).
-   Added missing `Refund.reason` value, increases field width (#1075).
-   Fixed `Refund.status` definition, reduces field width (#1076).
-   Deprecated non-standard `Invoice.status` (renamed to
    `Invoice.legacy_status`) to make way for the Stripe field
    (preparation for #1020).

### Note on usage of Stripe Elements JS

See [Integrating Stripe Elements](https://dj-stripe.github.io/dj-stripe/en/master/stripe_elements_js/)
for notes about usage of the Stripe Elements frontend JS library.

In summary: If you haven't yet migrated to PaymentIntents, prefer
`stripe.createSource()` to `stripe.createToken()`.

## 2.1.1 (2019-10-01)

This is a bugfix-only release:

-   Updated webhook signals list (#1000).
-   Fixed issue syncing PaymentIntent with destination charge (#960).
-   Fixed `Customer.subscription` and `.valid_subscriptions()` to ignore
    `status=incomplete_expired` (#1006).
-   Fixed error on `paymentmethod.detached` event with `card_xxx`
    payment methods (#967).
-   Added `PaymentMethod.detach()` (#943).
-   Updated `help_text` on all currency fields to make it clear if
    they're holding integer cents (`StripeQuantumCurrencyAmountField`)
    or decimal dollar (or euro, pound etc)
    (`StripeDecimalCurrencyAmountField`) (#999)
-   Documented our preferred Django model field types (#986)

### Upcoming migration of currency fields (storage as cents instead of dollars)

Please be aware that we're looking at standardising our currency storage
fields as integer quanta (cents) instead of Decimal (dollar) values, to
match stripe.

This is intended to be part of the 3.0 release, since it will involve
some breaking changes. See \#955 for details and discussion.

### Squashed dev migrations

As per our [migration policy](../project/contributing.md#django_migration_policy), unreleased migrations on the master
branch have been squashed.

If you have been using the 2.1.0dev branch from master, you'll need to
run the squashed migrations migrations before upgrading to >=2.1.0.

The simplest way to do this is to `pip install dj-stripe==2.1.0rc0` and
migrate, alternatively check out the `2.1.0rc0` git tag.

-   Fixed OperationalError seen in migration 0003 on postgres (#850).
-   Fixed issue with migration 0003 not being unapplied correctly (#882).

    but will be removed in the next version.

-   Dropped previously-deprecated `stripe_objects` module.
-   Dropped previously-deprecated `stripe_timestamp` field.
-   Dropped previously-deprecated `Charge.receipt_number` field.

-   All `stripe_id` fields have been renamed `id`.
-   `Charge.source_type` has been deprecated. Use `Charge.source.type`.
-   `Charge.source_stripe_id` has been deprecated. Use `Charge.source.id`.
-   All deprecated Transfer fields (Stripe API 2017-04-06 and older), have been dropped.
    This includes `date`, `destination_type` (`type`), `failure_code`,
    `failure_message`, `statement_descriptor` and `status`.
-   Fixed IntegrityError when `REMOTE_ADDR` is missing (#640).
-   New models:
    -   `ApplicationFee`
    -   `ApplicationFeeRefund`
    -   `BalanceTransaction`
    -   `CountrySpec`
    -   `ScheduledQuery`
    -   `SubscriptionItem`
    -   `TransferReversal`
    -   `UsageRecord`
-   The `fee` and `fee_details` attributes of both the `Charge` and `Transfer` objects
    are no longer stored in the database. Instead, they access their respective new
    `balance_transaction` foreign key. Note that `fee_details` has been deprecated on
    both models.
-   The `fraudulent` attribute on `Charge` is now a property that checks the
    `fraud_details` field.
-   Object key validity is now always enforced (\#503).
-   `Customer.sources` no longer refers to a Card queryset, but to a Source queryset. In
    order to correctly transition, you should change all your references to
    `customer.sources` to `customer.legacy_cards` instead. The `legacy_cards` attribute
    already exists in 1.2.0.
-   `Customer.sources_v3` is now named `Customer.sources`.
-   A new property `Customer.payment_methods` is now available, which allows you to
    iterate over all of a customer's payment methods (sources then cards).
-   `Card.customer` is now nullable and cards are no longer deleted when their
    corresponding customer is deleted (#654).
-   Webhook signature verification is now available and is preferred. Set the
    `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` setting to your secret to start using it.
-   `StripeObject` has been renamed `StripeModel`. An alias remains but will be removed
    in the next version.
-   The metadata key used in the `Customer` object can now be configured by changing the
    `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY` setting. Setting this to None or an empty string
    now also disables the behaviour altogether.
-   Text-type fields in dj-stripe will no longer ever be None. Instead, any falsy text
    field will return an empty string.
-   Switched test runner to pytest-django
-   `StripeModel.sync_from_stripe_data()` will now automatically retrieve related
    objects and populate foreign keys (#681)
-   Added `Coupon.name`
-   Added `Transfer.balance_transaction`
-   Exceptions in webhooks are now re-raised as well as saved in the database (#833)
