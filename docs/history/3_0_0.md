# dj-stripe 3.0.0 (20XX-XX-XX)

!!! attention

    3.0.0 is a significantly backwards-incompatible release. Migrating a 2.x database is
    unsupported due to significant changes to the data models.

## Release highlights

-   A new field `stripe_data` json field has been added to all
    supported models. This field contains a copy of the entire object as-is in the Stripe
    API.

## Breaking changes


!!! attention

    Many superfluous model fields have been removed, in favour of using `stripe_data`.
    We retain model fields for useful foreign keys and other frequently-used fields.

-   Migrations have been reset.
-   Removed deprecated `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE` setting.
-   Removed legacy `Customer.add_card()` method. Use `Custoner.add_payment_method()` instead.
-   Most of the models visible in the Django Admin are now read-only. (Note: This does
    not change anything functionally, as editing models was not replicated upstream.)
-   `DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD` setting has been removed, which drops support for
    legacy `djstripe_id` foreign keys.
- Support for webhook endpoints without `UUID` has been dropped
