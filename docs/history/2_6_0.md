# dj-stripe 2.6.0 (2022-01-15)

**Attention:**

    It is not possible to upgrade to dj-stripe 2.6.0 from versions older than 2.3.0.
    To upgrade from an older version, first upgrade to `dj-stripe 2.3.0`.

## Release highlights

-   Support for Python 3.10 and Django 4.0.
-   New models: Mandate, Payout, UsageRecordSummary, WebhookEndpoint (unused)
-   Significant improvements and fixes to Stripe Connect features.
-   Storing Stripe API keys by adding them to the Admin is now supported.
    This allows for use of multiple Stripe API keys (multiple Stripe accounts).
-   Support for syncing Connect accounts via `djstripe_sync_models`.

## Deprecated features

-   The use of the old `jsonfield`-based `JSONField` is deprecated and support for it
    will be dropped in dj-stripe 2.8.0. `django.models.JSONField` is available since
    Django 3.1.0. To switch to the newer JSONFields, set `DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD`
    to `True`. Set it to `False` to remain on the `jsonfield`-powered text-based fields.
    A manual migration is necessary to convert existing databases from text to json.
-   The `DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY` setting is deprecated and will be ignored in 2.8.
    Specify `proration_policy` in the `Subscription.update()` method explicitly instead.
-   `Customer.can_charge()` is now deprecated. This was a very misleading method which
    resulted in incorrect behaviour when Customers had multiple payment methods. It will
    be removed in dj-stripe 2.8.0. You can use `Customer.payment_methods.all()` instead.
-   For similar reasons, `Customer.has_valid_source()` is deprecated and will be removed
    in dj-stripe 2.8.0. You can use `Customer.sources.all()` instead.

## Breaking changes

-   Python 3.6 is no longer supported. The new minimum version of Python is 3.7.12.
-   Django 2.2 and 3.1 are no longer supported.
-   `DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD` now defaults to `True`. If you previously had it set
    to `False`, or did not have it set, you may want to explicitly set it to `False` in
    order to support a pre-existing database. A migration path will later be provided
    for this use case.
-   The undocumented `get_stripe_api_version()` helper function has been removed.
-   Settings for dj-stripe are now in `djstripe.settings.djstripe_settings` (as opposed
    to top-level in `djstripe.settings`)
-   `Customer.subscribe()` method no longer accepts positional arguments, only keywords.
-   `charge_immediately` support in Customer.subscribe() has been removed (deprecated
    in 2.4). Set `collection_method` instead.
-   The `at_period_end` argument to `Subscription.cancel()` now defaults to `False`,
    instead of the value of `DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY`.

## Other changes

-   The Stripe Account that triggered an Event is now available on the field
    `WebhookEventTrigger.stripe_trigger_account`.
-   Fixed recursive fetch/update loop errors in `djstripe_sync_models`.
-   Migrations have been optimized and should be faster.
-   dj-stripe now checks the apparent validity of API keys used and will raise
    `InvalidStripeAPIKey` if the API key looks completely incorrect.
-   `Customers` can now be subscribed to multiple prices and/or plans by passing the `items` argument
    to `Customer.subscribe()`.
-   Checkout Session metadata can be used to create/link a Stripe `Customer` to the
    `Customer` instance specified by the `djstripe_settings.SUBSCRIBER_CUSTOMER_KEY`.
