# dj-stripe 2.4.4 release notes (2021-05-22)

-   Fix syncing of tax IDs in management commands
-   Set `default_auto_field` in migrations to prevent creation of extra migrations
-   Misc test and documentation fixes

# dj-stripe 2.4.3 release notes (2021-02-08)

-   Fix webhook error when processing events that contain a reference to a deleted
    payment method (such as a refund on a payment whose card has been detached or
    removed)
-   Fix a couple of regressions in `djstripe_sync_models` management command.

# dj-stripe 2.4.2 release notes (2021-01-24)

## Release notes

-   Fix error in `Customer.add_card()` due to Stripe's `sources` deprecation. (#1293)
-   Fix `Subscription.update()` usage of the deprecated Stripe `prorate` argument.
    dj-stripe now explicitly uses `proration_behavior`, setting it to `"none"` when
    `prorate` is `False`, and `"create_prorations"` when `prorate` is `True`.

# dj-stripe 2.4.1 release notes (2020-11-29)

## Release notes

-   Upgrade default Stripe API version to `2020-08-27`. Although we documented doing so
    in 2.4.0, it was not correctly set as such. This has been fixed for consistency.
-   The `Price` model was incorrectly released with an `amount_in_cents` property,
    matching that of the `Plan` model. However, Price amounts are already in cent. The
    property has been removed, use `unit_amount` instead.
-   Fix `Price.human_readable_price` calculation
-   Fix non-blank nullable `Charge` fields
-   Fix Price.tiers not being synced correctly with `djstripe_sync_models` (#1284)
-   Fix sync model recursion loop (see #1288)
