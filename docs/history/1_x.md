## 1.2.0 (2018-06-11)

The dj-stripe 1.2.0 release resets all migrations.

**Do not upgrade to 1.2.0 directly from 1.0.1 or below. You must upgrade
to 1.1.0 first.**

Please read the 1.1.0 release notes below for more information.

## 1.1.0 (2018-06-11)

In dj-stripe 1.1.0, we made a _lot_ of changes to models in order to
bring the dj-stripe model state much closer to the upstream API objects.
If you are a current user of dj-stripe, you will most likely have to
make changes in order to upgrade. Please read the full changelog below.
If you are having trouble upgrading, you may ask for help [by filing an
issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/issues).

### Migration reset

The next version of dj-stripe, **1.2.0**, will reset all the migrations
to `0001_initial`. Migrations are currently in an unmaintainable state.

**What this means is you will not be able to upgrade directly to
dj-stripe 1.2.0. You must go through 1.1.0 first, run \`\`manage.py
migrate djstripe\`\`, then upgrade to 1.2.0.**

### Python 2.7 end-of-life

dj-stripe 1.1.0 drops support for Django 1.10 and adds support for
Django 2.0. Django 1.11+ and Python 2.7+ or 3.4+ are required.

Support for Python versions older than 3.5, and Django versions older
than 2.0, will be dropped in dj-stripe 2.0.0.

### Backwards-incompatible changes and deprecations

#### Removal of polymorphic models

The model architecture of dj-stripe has been simplified. Polymorphic
models have been dropped and the old base StripeCustomer, StripeCharge,
StripeInvoice, etc models have all been merged into the top-level
Customer, Charge, Invoice, etc models.

Importing those legacy models from `djstripe.stripe_objects` will yield
the new ones. This is deprecated and support for this will be dropped in
dj-stripe 2.0.0.

#### Full support for Stripe Sources (Support for v3 stripe.js)

Stripe sources (`src_XXXX`) are objects that can arbitrarily reference
any of the payment method types that Stripe supports. However, the
legacy `Card` object (with object IDs like `card_XXXX` or `cc_XXXX`) is
not a Source object, and cannot be turned into a Source object at this
time.

In order to support both Card and Source objects in ForeignKeys, a new
model `PaymentMethod` has been devised (renamed to
`DjstripePaymentMethod` in 2.0). That model can resolve into a Card, a
Source, or a BankAccount object.

-   **The \`\`default_source\`\` attribute on \`\`Customer\`\` now
    refers to a \`\`PaymentMethod\`\` object**. You will need to call
    `.resolve()` on it to get the Card or Source in question.
-   References to `Customer.sources` expecting a queryset of Card
    objects should be updated to `Customer.legacy_cards`.
-   The legacy `StripeSource` name refers to the `Card` model. This will
    be removed in dj-stripe 2.0.0. Update your references to either
    `Card` or `Source`.
-   `enums.SourceType` has been renamed to `enums.LegacySourceType`.
    `enums.SourceType` now refers to the actual Stripe Source types
    enum.

#### Core fields renamed

-   The numeric `id` field has been renamed to `djstripe_id`. This
    avoids a clash with the upstream stripe id. Accessing `.id` is
    deprecated and \*\*will reference the upstream `stripe_id` in
    dj-stripe 2.0.0

## 1.0.0 (2017-08-12)

It's finally here! We've made significant changes to the codebase and
are now compliant with stripe API version **2017-06-05**.

I want to give a huge thanks to all of our contributors for their help
in making this happen, especially Bill Huneke (@wahuneke) for his
impressive design work and @jleclanche for really pushing this release
along.

I also want to welcome onboard two more maintainers, @jleclanche and
@lskillen. They've stepped up and have graciously dedicated their
resources to making dj-stripe such an amazing package.

Almost all methods now mimic the parameters of those same methods in the
stripe API. Note that some methods do not have some parameters
implemented. This is intentional. That being said, expect all method
signatures to be different than those in previous versions of dj-stripe.

Finally, please note that there is still a bit of work ahead of us. Not
everything in the Stripe API is currently supported by dj-stripe --
we're working on it. That said, v1.0.0 has been thoroughly tested and is
verified stable in production applications.

### A few things to get excited for

-   Multiple subscription support (finally)
-   Multiple sources support (currently limited to Cards)
-   Idempotency support (See \#455, \#460 for discussion -- big thanks
    to @jleclanche)
-   Full model documentation
-   Objects that come through webhooks are now tied to the API version
    set in dj-stripe. No more errors if dj-stripe falls behind the
    newest stripe API version.
-   Any create/update action on an object automatically syncs the
    object.
-   Concurrent LIVE and TEST mode support (Thanks to @jleclanche). Note
    that you'll run into issues if `livemode` isn't set on your existing
    customer objects.
-   All choices are now enum-based (Thanks @jleclanche, See \#520).
    Access them from the new `djstripe.enums` module. The ability to
    check against model property based choices will be deprecated in 1.1
-   Support for the Coupon model, and coupons on Customer objects.
-   Support for the [Payout/Transfer
    split](https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split) from api
    version `2017-04-06`.

### What still needs to be done (in v1.1.0)

-   **Documentation**. Our original documentation was not very helpful,
    but it covered the important bits. It will be very out of date after
    this update and will need to be rewritten. If you feel like helping,
    we could use all the help we can get to get this pushed out asap.

-   **Master sync re-write**. This sounds scary, but really isn't. The
    current management methods run sync methods on Customer that aren't
    very helpful and are due for removal. My plan is to write something
    that first updates local data (via `api_retrieve` and
    `sync_from_stripe_data`) and then pulls all objects from Stripe and
    populates the local database with any records that don't already
    exist there.

    You might be wondering, "Why are they releasing this if there are
    only a few things left?" Well, that thinking turned this into a two
    year release... Trust me, this is a good thing.

### Significant changes (mostly backwards-incompatible)

-   **Idempotency**. \#460 introduces idempotency keys and implements
    idempotency for `Customer.get_or_create()`. Idempotency will be
    enabled for all calls that need it.
-   **Improved Admin Interface**. This is almost complete. See \#451 and
    \#452.
-   **Drop non-trivial endpoint views**. We're dropping everything
    except the webhook endpoint and the subscription cancel endpoint.
    See \#428.
-   **Drop support for sending receipts**. Stripe now handles this for
    you. See \#478.
-   **Drop support for plans as settings**, including custom plan
    hierarchy (if you want this, write something custom) and the dynamic
    trial callback. We've decided to gut having plans as settings.
    Stripe should be your source of truth; create your plans there and
    sync them down manually. If you need to create plans locally for
    testing, etc., simply use the ORM to create Plan models. The sync
    rewrite will make this drop less annoying.
-   **Orphan Customer Sync**. We will now sync Customer objects from
    Stripe even if they aren't linked to local subscriber objects. You
    can link up subscribers to those Customers manually.
-   **Concurrent Live and Test Mode**. dj-stripe now supports test-mode
    and live-mode Customer objects concurrently. As a result, the
    User.customer One-to-One reverse-relationship is now the
    User.djstripe_customers RelatedManager. (Thanks @jleclanche) \#440.
    You'll run into some dj-stripe check issues if you don't update your
    KEY settings accordingly. Check our GitHub issue tracker for help on
    this.

### SETTINGS

-   The `PLAN_CHOICES`, `PLAN_LIST`, and `PAYMENT_PLANS` objects are
    removed. Use Plan.objects.all() instead.
-   The `plan_from_stripe_id` function is removed. Use
    Plan.objects.get(stripe_id=)

### SYNCING

-   sync_plans no longer takes an api_key
-   sync methods no longer take a `cu` parameter
-   All sync methods are now private. We're in the process of building a
    better syncing mechanism.

### UTILITIES

-   dj-stripe decorators now take a plan argument. If you're passing in
    a custom test function to `subscriber_passes_pay_test`, be sure to
    account for this new argument.

### MIXINS

-   The context provided by dj-stripe's mixins has changed.
    `PaymentsContextMixin` now provides `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `plans`
    (changed to `Plan.objects.all()`). `SubscriptionMixin` now provides
    `customer` and `is_plans_plural`.
-   We've removed the SubscriptionPaymentRequiredMixin. Use
    `@method_decorator("dispatch",`[subscription_payment_required](https://github.com/kavdev/dj-stripe/blob/1.0.0/djstripe/decorators.py#L39)`)`
    instead.

### MIDDLEWARE

-   dj-stripe middleware doesn't support multiple subscriptions.

### SIGNALS

-   Local custom signals are deprecated in favor of Stripe webhooks:
-   `cancelled` -&gt;
    WEBHOOK_SIGNALS\["customer.subscription.deleted"\]
-   `card_changed` -&gt; WEBHOOK_SIGNALS\["customer.source.updated"\]
-   `subscription_made` -&gt;
    WEBHOOK_SIGNALS\["customer.subscription.created"\]

### WEBHOOK EVENTS

-   The Event Handlers designed by @wahuneke are the new way to handle
    events that come through webhooks. Definitely take a look at
    `event_handlers.py` and `webhooks.py`.

### EXCEPTIONS

-   `SubscriptionUpdateFailure` and `SubscriptionCancellationFailure`
    exceptions are removed. There should no longer be a case where they
    would have been useful. Catch native stripe errors in their place
    instead.

### MODELS

> **CHARGE**

-   `Charge.charge_created` -&gt; `Charge.stripe_timestamp`

-   `Charge.card_last_4` and `Charge.card_kind` are removed. Use
    `Charge.source.last4` and `Charge.source.brand` (if the source is a
    Card)

-   `Charge.invoice` is no longer a foreign key to the Invoice model.
    `Invoice` now has a OneToOne relationship with `Charge`.
    (`Charge.invoice` will still work, but will no longer be represented
    in the database).

    **CUSTOMER**

-   dj-stripe now supports test mode and live mode Customer objects
    concurrently (See \#440). As a result, the
    `<subscriber_model>.customer` OneToOne reverse relationship is no
    longer a thing. You should now instead add a `customer` property to
    your subscriber model that checks whether you're in live or test
    mode (see djstripe.settings.STRIPE_LIVE_MODE as an example) and
    grabs the customer from `<subscriber_model>.djstripe_customers` with
    a simple `livemode=` filter.

-   Customer no longer has a `current_subscription` property. We've
    added a `subscription` property that should suit your needs.

-   With the advent of multiple subscriptions, the behavior of
    `Customer.subscribe()` has changed. Before, `calling subscribe()`
    when a customer was already subscribed to a plan would switch the
    customer to the new plan with an option to prorate. Now calling
    `subscribe()` simply subscribes that customer to a new plan in
    addition to it's current subsription. Use `Subscription.update()` to
    change a subscription's plan instead.

-   `Customer.cancel_subscription()` is removed. Use
    `Subscription.cancel()` instead.

-   The `Customer.update_plan_quantity()` method is removed. Use
    `Subscription.update()` instead.

-   `CustomerManager` is now `SubscriptionManager` and works on the
    `Subscription` model instead of the `Customer` model.

-   `Customer.has_valid_card()` is now `Customer.has_valid_source()`.

-   `Customer.update_card()` now takes an id. If the id is not supplied,
    the default source is updated.

-   `Customer.stripe_customer` property is removed. Use
    `Customer.api_retrieve()` instead.

-   The `at_period_end` parameter of `Customer.cancel_subscription()`
    now actually follows the
    [DJSTRIPE_PRORATION_POLICY](../reference/settings.md#djstripe_proration_policy-false)
    setting.

-   `Customer.card_fingerprint`, `Customer.card_last_4`,
    `Customer.card_kind`, `Customer.card_exp_month`,
    `Customer.card_exp_year` are all removed. Check
    `Customer.default_source` (if it's a Card) or one of the sources in
    `Customer.sources` (again, if it's a Card) instead.

-   The `invoice_id` parameter of `Customer.add_invoice_item` is now
    named `invoice` and can be either an Invoice object or the
    stripe_id of an Invoice.

    **EVENT**

-   `Event.kind` -&gt; `Event.type`

-   Removed `Event.validated_message`. Just check if the event is valid

    -   no need to double check (we do that for you)

    **TRANSFER**

-   Removed `Transfer.update_status()`

-   Removed `Transfer.event`

-   `TransferChargeFee` is removed. It hasn't been used in a while due
    to a broken API version. Use `Transfer.fee_details` instead.

-   Any fields that were in `Transfer.summary` no longer exist and are
    therefore deprecated (unused but not removed from the database).
    Because of this, `TransferManager` now only aggregates `total_sum`

    **INVOICE**

-   `Invoice.attempts` -&gt; `Invoice.attempt_count`

-   InvoiceItems are no longer created when Invoices are synced. You
    must now sync InvoiceItems directly.

    **INVOICEITEM**

-   Removed `InvoiceItem.line_type`

    **PLAN**

-   Plan no longer has a `stripe_plan` property. Use `api_retrieve()`
    instead.

-   `Plan.currency` no longer uses choices. Use the
    `get_supported_currency_choices()` utility and create your own
    custom choices list instead.

-   Plan interval choices are now in `Plan.INTERVAL_TYPE_CHOICES`

    **SUBSCRIPTION**

-   `Subscription.is_period_current()` now checks for a current trial
    end if the current period has ended. This change means subscriptions
    extended with `Subscription.extend()` will now be seen as valid.

### MIGRATIONS

We'll sync your current records with Stripe in a migration. It will take
a while, but it's the only way we can ensure data integrity. There were
some fields for which we needed to temporarily add placeholder defaults,
so just make sure you have a customer with ID 1 and a plan with ID 1 and
you shouldn't run into any issues (create dummy values for these if need
be and delete them after the migration).

### BIG HUGE NOTE - DON'T OVERLOOK THIS

!!! warning

    Subscription and InvoiceItem migration is not possible because old
    records don't have Stripe IDs (so we can't sync them). Our approach is
    to delete all local subscription and invoiceitem objects and re-sync
    them from Stripe.

    We 100% recommend you create a backup of your database before performing
    this upgrade.
